how might primary angiitis of the central nervous system be treated the current treatment recommendation is to start with oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg kg per day and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 mg kg per day most centers use prednisone and cyclophosphamide for 4 6 months to induce clinical remission and then taper prednisone off patients generally stay on cyclophosphamide therapy between three and six months depending on when remission occurs and if there are any potential side effects from cyclophosphamide once cyclophosphamide is discontinued it should be replaced with a less toxic medication for an additional six to twelve months of maintenance therapy some doctors switch from cyclophosphamide to azathioprine 2 mg kg or mycophenolate mofetil methotrexate can also be used but may be limited by its difficulty to cross the blood brain barrier there is limited data on how long the maintenance therapy lasts so the decision on the duration of the therapy should be individualized based upon how the patient responds to therapy,primary angiitis of the central nervous system,,,Primary angiitis of the central nervous system,,

how might pineal cysts be treated the best treatment options for pineal cysts depend on many factors including the size of the cyst and whether or not it is associated with symptoms for example people with pineal cysts that do not cause symptoms may not require any form of treatment however they may need to have regular check ups with a physician and follow up imaging if they have a large cyst greater than 10 14 mm or develop symptoms that could be related to the cyst treatment is often recommended for those individuals with pineal cysts that cause hydrocephalus neurological symptoms such as headache or disturbance of vision or enlargement of the cyst over time treatment may include surgery to remove the cyst sometimes followed by the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt aspiration of the contents of the cyst using ultrasound guidance has been explored as an alternative approach to surgery and more recently endoscopic procedures have been used radiation therapy may be recommended for cysts that recur after treatment what is the appropriate follow up for a pineal cyst found incidentally on mri there is limited information about what happens to a pineal cyst over time several studies have shown that most pineal cysts remain stable and do not increase in size or cause symptoms later in life one study found that larger cysts were more likely to decrease in size over time and there is currently no evidence that larger cysts are more likely to cause symptoms because guidelines for management depend on an understanding of the typical course of a condition and currently there is limited information about pineal cysts there is some debate about the most appropriate way to manage these cysts some studies do not recommend repeated magnetic resonance imaging mri of the cyst other studies state that repeated imaging of a pineal cyst is not required another approach is for individuals with a pineal cyst to have regular check ups with their personal doctor if at any point new symptoms arise that may be related to the pineal cyst repeat imaging should be done,"pineal cysts, hydrocephalus, headache","surgery, ultrasound, radiation therapy",,"Headache, Hydrocephalus, Pineal cyst","Radiation Therapy, Surgery, Ultrasound",

deep brain stimulation dbs is a surgical procedure used to treat several disabling neurological symptomsmost commonly the debilitating motor symptoms of parkinsons disease pd such as tremor rigidity stiffness slowed movement and walking problems the procedure is also used to treat essential tremor and dystonia at present the procedure is used only for individuals whose symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with medications however only individuals who improve to some degree after taking medication for parkinsons benefit from dbs a variety of conditions may mimic pd but do not respond to medications or dbs dbs uses a surgically implanted battery operated medical device called an implantable pulse generator ipg similar to a heart pacemaker and approximately the size of a stopwatch to deliver electrical stimulation to specific areas in the brain that control movement thus blocking the abnormal nerve signals that cause pd symptoms before the procedure a neurosurgeon uses magnetic resonance imaging mri or computed tomography ct scanning to identify and locate the exact target within the brain for surgical intervention some surgeons may use microelectrode recording which involves a small wire that monitors the activity of nerve cells in the target area to more specifically identify the precise brain area that will be stimulated generally these areas are the thalamus subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus there is a low chance that placement of the stimulator may cause bleeding or infection in the brain the dbs system consists of three components the lead the extension and the ipg the lead also called an electrode a thin insulated wireis inserted through a small opening in the skull and implanted in the brain the tip of the electrode is positioned within the specific brain area the extension is an insulated wire that is passed under the skin of the head neck and shoulder connecting the lead to the implantable pulse generator the ipg the battery pack is the third component and is usually implanted under the skin near the collarbone in some cases it may be implanted lower in the chest or under the skin over the abdomen once the system is in place electrical impulses are sent from the ipg up along the extension wire and the lead and into the brain these impulses block abnormal electrical signals and alleviate pd motor symptoms,"tremor, essential tremor, dystonia, bleeding",,,"Tremor, Dystonia, Bleeding, Walking Problems, Essential tremor",,

standard treatment because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists pediatrician hematologist medical oncologist pediatric surgeon radiation oncologist neurologist neuropathologist neuroradiologist pediatric nurse specialist social worker rehabilitation specialist psychologist some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended regular follow up exams are very important some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended these are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include physical problems changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory second cancers new types of cancer some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important that parents of children who are treated for aml or other blood diseases talk with their doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information the treatment of childhood aml usually has two phases the treatment of childhood aml is done in phases induction therapy this is the first phase of treatment the goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow this puts the leukemia into remission consolidation intensification therapy this is the second phase of treatment it begins once the leukemia is in remission the goal of therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse treatment called central nervous system cns sanctuary therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the cns brain and spinal cord the cells are able to find sanctuary hide in the cns intrathecal chemotherapy is able to reach leukemia cells in the cns it is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur come back cns sanctuary therapy is also called cns prophylaxis seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood aml childhood cml jmml or mds chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated in aml the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and or spinal cord chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat aml may not cross the blood brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord instead chemotherapy is injected into the fluid filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there intrathecal chemotherapy see drugs approved for acute myeloid leukemia for more information radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated in childhood aml external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy stem cell transplant stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the body s blood cells targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells types of targeted therapy include the following tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow tkis block the enzyme tyrosine kinase that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells granulocytes or blasts than the body needs tkis may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy treatment given after the initial treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back imatinib is a type of tki that is approved to treat childhood cml sorafenib dasatinib and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia monoclonal antibody therapy monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of aml called acute promyelocytic leukemia apl gemtuzumab is not available in the united states unless special approval is given monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy proteasome inhibitor therapy proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood apl see drugs approved for leukemia for more information other drug therapy lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change arsenic trioxide and all trans retinoic acid atra are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells stop the leukemia cells from dividing or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells these drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia see drugs approved for acute myeloid leukemia for more information watchful waiting watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change it is sometimes used to treat mds or tmd supportive care supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment supportive care may include the following transfusion therapy a way of giving red blood cells white blood cells or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment the blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed drug therapy such as antibiotics or antifungal agents leukapheresis a procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed the rest of the blood is then returned to the patient s bloodstream new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy natural killer nk cells are a type of biologic therapy nk cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells these may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your child s condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or

what causes tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome traps traps is a genetic condition caused by mutations in a gene called tnfrsf1a this gene gives the body instructions to make a protein called tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 tnfr1 this protein exists in cell membranes where it binds to another protein called tumor necrosis factor tnf the binding sends signals that tell the cells to trigger inflammation producing immune system proteins or self destruct most tnfrsf1a gene mutations that cause traps result in incorrectly shaped tnfr1 proteins which become trapped in cells and cannot reach the surface to bind with tnf the trapped proteins then clump together and are thought to trigger other pathways involved in causing inflammation affected people typically have a mutation in only one of their 2 copies of the tnfrsf1a gene so some normal tnfr1 proteins are still produced leading to even more inflammation this is what leads to excess inflammation in people with traps it is unclear if abnormalities in the cells ability to self destruct also plays a role in causing the features of traps,,,,Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome,,

key points after hypopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the hypopharynx or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for hypopharyngeal cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv after hypopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the hypopharynx or to other parts of the body the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the hypopharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment the results of some of the tests used to diagnose hypopharyngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if hypopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually hypopharyngeal cancer cells the disease is metastatic hypopharyngeal cancer not lung cancer the following stages are used for hypopharyngeal cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ in stage 0 abnormal cells are found in the lining of the hypopharynx these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ stage i in stage i cancer has formed in one area of the hypopharynx only and or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller stage ii in stage ii the tumor is either larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and has not spread to the larynx voice box or found in more than one area of the hypopharynx or in nearby tissues stage iii in stage iii the tumor is larger than 4 centimeters or has spread to the larynx voice box or esophagus cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller or has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and cancer is found in one area of the hypopharynx and or is 2 centimeters or smaller or in more than one area of the hypopharynx or in nearby tissues or is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and has not spread to the larynx stage iv stage iv is divided into stage iva ivb and ivc as follows in stage iva cancer has spread to cartilage around the thyroid or trachea the bone under the tongue the thyroid or nearby soft tissue cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller or has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters or to lymph nodes anywhere in the neck affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller and one of the following is true cancer is found in one area of the hypopharynx and or is 2 centimeters or smaller or cancer is found in more than one area of the hypopharynx or in nearby tissues or is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and has not spread to the larynx voice box or cancer has spread to the larynx or esophagus and is more than 4 centimeters or cancer has spread to cartilage around the thyroid or trachea the bone under the tongue the thyroid or nearby soft tissue in stage ivb the tumor has spread to muscles around the upper part of the spinal column the carotid artery or the lining of the chest cavity and may have spread to lymph nodes which can be any size or may be any size and has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters in stage ivc the tumor may be any size and has spread beyond the hypopharynx to other parts of the body,"hypopharyngeal cancer, cancer, lung cancer, soft

mutations in the prkag2 gene cause wolff parkinson white syndrome a small percentage of all cases of wolff parkinson white syndrome are caused by mutations in the prkag2 gene some people with these mutations also have features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart cardiac muscle the prkag2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of an enzyme called amp activated protein kinase ampk this enzyme helps sense and respond to energy demands within cells it is likely involved in the development of the heart before birth although its role in this process is unknown researchers are uncertain how prkag2 mutations lead to the development of wolff parkinson white syndrome and related heart abnormalities research suggests that these mutations alter the activity of amp activated protein kinase in the heart although it is unclear whether the genetic changes overactivate the enzyme or reduce its activity studies indicate that changes in amp activated protein kinase activity allow a complex sugar called glycogen to build up abnormally within cardiac muscle cells other studies have found that altered amp activated protein kinase activity is related to changes in the regulation of certain ion channels in the heart these channels which transport positively charged atoms ions into and out of cardiac muscle cells play critical roles in maintaining the heart s normal rhythm in most cases the cause of wolff parkinson white syndrome is unknown,cardiomyopathy,,,"Cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome",,

key points after endometrial cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for endometrial cancer stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows low risk endometrial cancer high risk endometrial cancer after endometrial cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body the process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process a hysterectomy an operation in which the uterus is removed will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread the following procedures may be used in the staging process pelvic exam an exam of the vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes ovaries and rectum a speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease a pap test of the cervix is usually done the doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size shape and position of the uterus and ovaries the doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas chest x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the chest an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do lymph node dissection a surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells the disease is metastatic endometrial cancer not lung cancer the following stages are used for endometrial cancer stage i in stage i cancer is found in the uterus only stage i is divided into stages ia and ib based on how far the cancer has spread stage ia cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium muscle layer of the uterus stage ib cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium stage ii in stage ii cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix but has not spread outside the uterus stage iii in stage iii cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix but has not spread beyond the pelvis stage iii is divided into stages iiia iiib and iiic based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis stage iiia cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and or to the fallopian tubes ovaries and ligaments of the uterus stage iiib cancer has spread to the vagina and or to the parametrium connective tissue and fat around the uterus stage iiic cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and or around the aorta largest artery in the body which carries blood away from the heart stage iv in stage iv cancer has spread beyond the pelvis stage iv is divided into stages iva and ivb based on how far the cancer has spread stage iva cancer has spread to the bladder and or bowel wall stage ivb cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis including the abdomen and or lymph nodes in the groin endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows low risk endometrial cancer grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low risk they usually do not spread to other parts of the body high risk endometrial cancer grade 3

if you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories this will reveal whether you or your family members including women and girls have bleeding problems however some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease you or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia blood tests are used to find out how long it takes for your blood to clot whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood the test results will show whether you have hemophilia what type of hemophilia you have and how severe it is hemophilia a and b are classified as mild moderate or severe depending on the amount of clotting factor viii or ix in the blood the severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories for example some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies thus children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life people who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they re adults the bleeding problems of hemophilia a and hemophilia b are the same only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has knowing which type is important because the treatments are different pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies women who are hemophilia carriers also can have preimplantation diagnosis to have children who don t have hemophilia for this process women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory the embryos are then tested for hemophilia only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb,"bleeding, hemophilia, hemophilia b",,,"Hemophilia, Bleeding, Hemophilia B",,

is radiation therapy a recommended treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma unfortunately because microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare cancer there is currently not enough information to determine if radiation therapy is an effective treatment for this disease there are no guidelines for the use of radiation therapy as treatment for microcystic adnexal carcinoma and little is known about the dose of radiation that might be needed to be effective two articles studying a total of 17 patients receiving radiation therapy for microcystic adnexal carcinoma have suggested that there may be a benefit of radiation therapy for decreasing the chances of the tumor regrowing recurrence and the authors suggest that this treatment could be considered if there is evidence that cancer cells remain after surgery or in situations where additional surgery cannot be done however another article raises concerns about the use of radiation therapy considering the small number of patients studied the report of one patient s disease potentially worsening after radiation therapy and the belief that exposure to radiation may be a risk factor for the initial development of this tumor,"microcystic adnexal carcinoma, cancer","radiation therapy, surgery",,"Cancer, Microcystic adnexal carcinoma","Radiation Therapy, Surgery",

cardiogenic shock is life threatening and requires emergency medical treatment the condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack if the person isn t already in a hospital emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive the first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs sometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time for example doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that s damaging the heart often this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment emergency life support emergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock this treatment helps get oxygen rich blood flowing to the brain kidneys and other organs restoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long term damage to the organs emergency life support treatment includes giving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs the heart and the rest of the body providing breathing support if needed a ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen a ventilator is a machine that supports breathing giving the patient fluids including blood and blood products through a needle inserted in a vein when the shock is due to blood loss this can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body this treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can t pump the blood that s already in the body also too much fluid is in the lungs making it hard to breathe medicines during and after emergency life support treatment doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock if the reason for the shock is that the heart isn t pumping strongly enough then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock treatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause doctors may prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots from forming increase the force with which the heart muscle contracts treat a heart attack medical devices medical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include an intra aortic balloon pump this device is placed in the aorta the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body a balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm this allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can which helps get more blood to vital organs such as the brain and kidneys a left ventricular assist device lvad this device is a battery operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action an lvad helps the heart pump blood to the body this device may be used if damage to the left ventricle the hearts main pumping chamber is causing shock medical procedures and surgery sometimes medicines and medical devices aren t enough to treat cardiogenic shock medical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body repair heart damage and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock surgery also can improve the chances of long term survival surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival the types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include percutaneous coronary intervention pci and stents pci also known as coronary angioplasty is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary heart arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack a stent is a small mesh tube that s placed in a coronary artery during pci to help keep it open coronary artery bypass grafting for this surgery arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass that is go around narrowed coronary arteries this creates a new passage for oxygen rich blood to reach the heart surgery to repair damaged heart valves surgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers this break is called a septal rupture heart transplant this type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options also doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor still in some cases doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it s the best way to improve a patient s chances of long term survival,"shock, heart attack, blood clots","surgery, angioplasty, heart surgery",,"Heart Attack, Shock, Blood Clots","Surgery, Angioplasty",

how might congenital chloride diarrhea be treated there is no cure for the underlying condition so treatment mainly focuses on the symptoms studies have shown that early diagnosis and aggressive salt replacement therapy replacing sodium and chloride the 2 things that make up salt are associated with normal growth and development in addition to reduced mortality rates in individuals with this condition the goal is for the oral intake of chloride sodium and potassium to be greater than the amount lost through the feces i e there must be a positive gastrointestinal balance so that losses in sweat can be replaced replacement therapy with nacl sodium chloride and kcl potassium chloride has been shown to be effective in children one study showed that a medication called omeprazole a proton pump inhibitor reduces electrolyte losses in individuals and thus promotes a positive gastrointestinal balance however this treatment does not reduce the need for careful monitoring of dietary intake electrolyte concentrations and urinary chloride loss another study discussed how butyrate could be effective in treating the condition and that it is easily administered useful in preventing severe dehydration episodes and may be a promising approach for a long term treatment,"congenital chloride diarrhea, dehydration",,,"Diarrhea, Dehydration, Congenital chloride diarrhea",,

a person infected with pinworm is often asymptomatic but itching around the anus is a common symptom diagnosis of pinworm can be reached from three simple techniques the first option is to look for the worms in the perianal reqion 2 to 3 hours after the infected person is asleep the second option is to touch the perianal skin with transparent tape to collect possible pinworm eggs around the anus first thing in the morning if a person is infected the eggs on the tape will be visible under a microscope the tape method should be conducted on 3 consecutive mornings right after the infected person wakes up and before he she does any washing since anal itching is a common symptom of pinworm the third option for diagnosis is analyzing samples from under fingernails under a microscope an infected person who has scratched the anal area may have picked up some pinworm eggs under the nails that could be used for diagnosis since pinworm eggs and worms are often sparse in stool examining stool samples is not recommended serologic tests are not available for diagnosing pinworm infections,itching,,,Itching,,

sick sinus syndrome can result from genetic or environmental factors in many cases the cause of the condition is unknown genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome mutations in two genes scn5a and hcn4 have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families these genes provide instructions for making proteins called ion channels that transport positively charged atoms ions into cardiac cells including cells that make up the sa node the flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and coordinate contraction of the cardiac muscle mutations in these genes reduce the flow of ions which alters the sa node s ability to create and spread electrical signals these changes lead to abnormal heartbeats and the other symptoms of sick sinus syndrome a particular variation in another gene myh6 appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome the protein produced from the myh6 gene forms part of a larger protein called myosin which generates the mechanical force needed for cardiac muscle to contract researchers believe that the myh6 gene variation changes the structure of myosin which can affect cardiac muscle contraction and increase the likelihood of developing an abnormal heartbeat more commonly sick sinus syndrome is caused by other factors that alter the structure or function of the sa node these include a variety of heart conditions other disorders such as muscular dystrophy abnormal inflammation or a shortage of oxygen hypoxia certain medications such as drugs given to treat abnormal heart rhythms or high blood pressure can also disrupt sa node function one of the most common causes of sick sinus syndrome in children is trauma to the sa node such as damage that occurs during heart surgery in older adults sick sinus syndrome is often associated with age related changes in the heart over time the sa node may harden and develop scar like damage fibrosis that prevents it from working properly,"muscular dystrophy, high blood pressure",heart surgery,,"High Blood Pressure, Muscular Dystrophy","Surgery, Heart Surgery",

dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is associated with a rearrangement translocation of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22 this translocation written as t 17 22 fuses part of the col1a1 gene from chromosome 17 with part of the pdgfb gene from chromosome 22 the translocation is found on one or more extra chromosomes that can be either the normal linear shape or circular when circular the extra chromosomes are known as supernumerary ring chromosomes ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure other genes from chromosomes 17 and 22 can be found on the extra chromosomes but the role these genes play in development of the condition is unclear the translocation is acquired during a person s lifetime and the chromosomes containing the translocation are present only in the tumor cells this type of genetic change is called a somatic mutation in normal cells the col1a1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type i collagen which strengthens and supports many tissues in the body the pdgfb gene provides instructions for making one version isoform of the platelet derived growth factor pdgf protein by attaching to its receptor the active pdgfb protein stimulates many cellular processes including cell growth and division proliferation and maturation differentiation the abnormally fused col1a1 pdgfb gene provides instructions for making an abnormal combined fusion protein that researchers believe ultimately functions like the pdgfb protein the gene fusion leads to the production of an excessive amount of protein that functions like the pdgfb protein in excess this fusion protein stimulates cells to proliferate and differentiate abnormally leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans the col1a1 pdgfb fusion gene is found in more than 90 percent of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans cases in the remaining cases changes in other genes may be associated with this condition these genes have not been identified,dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,,,Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,,
mutations in the htt gene cause huntington disease the htt gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin although the function of this protein is unknown it appears to play an important role in nerve cells neurons in the brain the htt mutation that causes huntington disease involves a dna segment known as a cag trinucleotide repeat this segment is made up of a series of three dna building blocks cytosine adenine and guanine that appear multiple times in a row normally the cag segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene in people with huntington disease the cag segment is repeated 36 to more than 120 times people with 36 to 39 cag repeats may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of huntington disease while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder an increase in the size of the cag segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein the elongated protein is cut into smaller toxic fragments that bind together and accumulate in neurons disrupting the normal functions of these cells the dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of huntington disease,huntington disease,,,Huntington disease,,
is mecp2 duplication syndrome inherited mecp2 duplication syndrome is inherited in an x linked manner a condition is considered x linked if the genetic change that causes the condition is located on the x chromosome one of the two sex chromosomes the y chromosome is the other sex chromosome in males who have only one x chromosome a duplication of the mecp2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in females who have two x chromosomes a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene typically does not cause the disorder early in the development of females one of the two x chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in each cell called x inactivation x inactivation prevents female cells from having twice as many functional x chromosomes as males because x inactivation is usually random the x chromosome inherited from the mother is active in some cells and the x chromosome inherited from the father is active in other cells however when a female has an x chromosome with a duplicated copy of the mecp2 gene the abnormal chromosome is often preferentially inactivated in many or all cells this is called skewed x inactivation it prevents some women with an mecp2 duplication from developing features of the duplication since the extra genetic material is not active in most cases mecp2 duplication syndrome is inherited from a mother who has no signs or symptoms of the duplication rarely the condition is not inherited and occurs due to a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm or in early fetal development when this happens it is called a de novo duplication occurring as a new genetic change for the first time in the affected person,mecp2 duplication syndrome,,,MECP2 duplication syndrome,,

nephrotic syndrome can be caused by diseases that affect only the kidneys such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs or membranous nephropathy diseases that affect only the kidneys are called primary causes of nephrotic syndrome the glomeruli are usually the targets of these diseases for reasons that are not fully understood in fsgsthe most common primary cause of nephrotic syndromescar tissue forms in parts of the glomeruli in membranous nephropathy immune molecules form harmful deposits on the glomeruli nephrotic syndrome can also be caused by systemic diseases which are diseases that affect many parts of the body such as diabetes or lupus systemic diseases that affect the kidneys are called secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome more than 50 percent of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults have secondary causes with diabetes being the most common 1,"membranous nephropathy, diabetes, lupus",,,"Diabetes, Lupus, Membranous nephropathy",,
this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition,,,,,,
mutations in the slc5a1 gene cause glucose galactose malabsorption the slc5a1 gene provides instructions for producing a sodium glucose cotransporter protein called sglt1 this protein is found mainly in the intestinal tract and to a lesser extent in the kidneys where it is involved in transporting glucose and the structurally similar galactose across cell membranes the sodium glucose cotransporter protein is important in the functioning of intestinal epithelial cells which are cells that line the walls of the intestine these cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine based on their appearance groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border the sodium glucose cotransporter protein is involved in the process of using energy to move glucose and galactose across the brush border membrane for absorption a mechanism called active transport sodium and water are transported across the brush border along with the sugars in this process mutations that prevent the sodium glucose cotransporter protein from performing this function result in a buildup of glucose and galactose in the intestinal tract this failure of active transport prevents the glucose and galactose from being absorbed and providing nourishment to the body in addition the water that normally would have been transported across the brush border with the sugar instead remains in the intestinal tract to be expelled with the stool resulting in dehydration of the body s tissues and severe diarrhea,"dehydration, diarrhea",,,"Diarrhea, Dehydration",,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer seven types of standard treatment are used watchful waiting or active surveillance surgery radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy hormone therapy chemotherapy biologic therapy bisphosphonate therapy there are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials cryosurgery high intensityfocused ultrasound therapy proton beam radiation therapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with prostate cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment seven types of standard treatment are used watchful waiting or active surveillance watchful waiting and active surveillance are treatments used for older men who do not have signs or symptoms or have other medical conditions and for men whose prostate cancer is found during a screening test watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life active surveillance is closely following a patient s condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results it is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse in active surveillance patients are given certain exams and tests including digital rectal exam psa test transrectal ultrasound and transrectal needle biopsy to check if the cancer is growing when the cancer begins to grow treatment is given to cure the cancer other terms that are used to describe not giving treatment to cure prostate cancer right after diagnosis are observation watch and wait and expectant management surgery patients in good health whose tumor is in the prostate gland only may be treated with surgery to remove the tumor the following types of surgery are used radical prostatectomy a surgical procedure to remove the prostate surrounding tissue and seminal vesicles there are two types of radical prostatectomy retropubic prostatectomy a surgical procedure to remove the prostate through an incision cut in the abdominal wall removal of nearby lymph nodes may be done at the same time perineal prostatectomy a surgical procedure to remove the prostate through an incision cut made in the perineum area between the scrotum and anus nearby lymph nodes may also be removed through a separate incision in the abdomen pelvic lymphadenectomy a surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the pelvis a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if the lymph nodes contain cancer the doctor will not remove the prostate and may recommend other treatment transurethral resection of the prostate turp a surgical procedure to remove tissue from the prostate using a resectoscope a thin lighted tube with a cutting tool inserted through the urethra this procedure is done to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy and it is sometimes done to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor before other cancer treatment is given turp may also be done in men whose tumor is in the prostate only and who cannot have a radical prostatectomy in some cases nerve sparing surgery can be done this type of surgery may save the nerves that control erection however men with large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves may not be able to have this surgery possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include the following impotence leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum shortening of the penis 1 to 2 centimeters the exact reason for this is not known inguinal hernia bulging of fat or part of the small intestine through weak muscles into the groin inguinal hernia may occur more often in men treated with radical prostatectomy than in men who have some other types of prostate surgery radiation therapy or prostate biopsy alone it is most likely to occur within the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are different types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer conformal radiation is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 dimensional 3 d picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor this allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue hypofractionated radiation therapy may be given because it has a more convenient treatment schedule hypofractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a larger than usual total dose of radiation is given once a day over a shorter period of time fewer days compared to standard radiation therapy hypofractionated radiation therapy may have worse side effects than standard radiation therapy depending on the schedules used internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer in early stage prostate cancer the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate using needles that are inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum the placement of the radioactive seeds in the prostate is guided by images from transrectal ultrasound or computed tomography ct the needles are removed after the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate radiopharmaceutical therapy uses a radioactive substance to treat cancer radiopharmaceutical therapy includes the following alpha emitter radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone a radioactive substance called radium 223 is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radium 223 collects in areas of bone with cancer and kills the cancer cells the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy internal radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having bladder and or gastrointestinal cancer radiation therapy can cause impotence and urinary problems hormone therapy hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream in prostate cancer male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow drugs surgery or other hormones are used to reduce the amount of male hormones or block them from working hormone therapy for prostate cancer may include the following luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists can stop the testicles from making testosterone examples are leuprolide goserelin and buserelin antiandrogens can block the action of androgens hormones that promote male sex characteristics such as testosterone examples are flutamide bicalutamide enzalutamide and nilutamide drugs that can prevent the adrenal glands from making androgens include ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide orchiectomy is a surgical procedure to remove one or both testicles the main source of male hormones such as testosterone to decrease the amount of hormone being made estrogens hormones that promote female sex characteristics can prevent the testicles from making testosterone however estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects hot flashes impaired sexual function loss of desire for sex and weakened bones may occur in men treated with hormone therapy other side effects include diarrhea nausea and itching see drugs approved for prostate cancer for more information chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for prostate cancer for more information biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer sipuleucel t is a type of biologic therapy used to treat prostate cancer that has metastasized spread to other parts of the body see drugs approved for prostate cancer for more information bisphosphonate therapy bisphosphonate drugs such as clodronate or zoledronate reduce bone disease when cancer has spread to the bone men who are treated with antiandrogen therapy or orchiectomy are at an increased risk of bone loss in these men bisphosphonate drugs lessen the risk of bone fracture breaks the use of bisphosphonate drugs to prevent or slow the growth of bone metastases is being studied in clinical trials there are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and certain types of hormone therapy can weaken bones and lead to bone pain treatments for bone pain include the following pain medicine external radiation therapy strontium 89 a radioisotope targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody such as denosumab bisphosphonate therapy corticosteroids see the pdq summary on pain for more information new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website cryosurgery cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy prostate cancer cells ultrasound is used to find the area that will be treated this type of treatment is also called cryotherapy cryosurgery can cause impotence and leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum high intensityfocused ultrasound therapy high intensityfocused ultrasound therapy is a treatment that uses ultrasound high energy sound waves to destroy cancer cells to treat prostate cancer an endorectal probe is used to make the sound waves proton beam radiation therapy proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high energy external radiation therapy that targets tumors with streams of protons small positively charged particles this type of radiation therapy is being studied in the treatment of prostate cancer patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes

lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure chemopreventive agents it is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma sunscreen counseling and protecting the skin from the sun cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer new ways to prevent skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers risk factors include smoking being overweight and not getting enough exercise increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet uv radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to uv radiation are risk factors for skin cancer uv radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun sunlamps and tanning beds also give off uv radiation risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight such as from tanning beds over long periods of time having a fair complexion which includes the following fair skin that freckles and burns easily does not tan or tans poorly blue or green or other light colored eyes red or blond hair having actinic keratosis past treatment with radiation having a weakened immune system being exposed to arsenic risk factors for melanoma skin cancer having a fair complexion which includes the following fair skin that freckles and burns easily does not tan or tans poorly blue or green or other light colored eyes red or blond hair being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight such as from tanning beds over long periods of time having a history of many blistering sunburns especially as a child or teenager having several large or many small moles having a family history of unusual moles atypical nevus syndrome having a family or personal history of melanoma being white it is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure it is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun using sunscreens or wearing protective clothing when outdoors this is because not enough studies have been done to prove this sunscreen may help decrease the amount of uv radiation to the skin one study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma the harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin d made in the skin because of less sun exposure it is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful uv radiation although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer skin experts suggest the following use sunscreen that protects against uv radiation do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time especially when the sun is at its strongest wear long sleeve shirts long pants sun hats and sunglasses when outdoors chemopreventive agents chemoprevention is the use of drugs vitamins or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer the following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer beta carotene studies of beta carotene taken as a supplement in pills have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back isotretinoin high doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum however isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects selenium studies have shown that selenium taken in brewer s yeast tablets does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma celecoxib a study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels alpha difluoromethylornithine dfmo a study of alpha difluoromethylornithine dfmo in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took dfmo had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo dfmo may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary nicotinamide vitamin b3 studies have shown that nicotinamide vitamin b3 helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide more studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back it is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma sunscreen it has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by uv radiation other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily having a large number of benign moles or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms counseling and protecting the skin from the sun it is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for

hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome is a disorder characterized by an excess of an iron storage protein called ferritin in the blood hyperferritinemia and tissues of the body a buildup of this protein begins early in life leading to clouding of the lenses of the eyes cataracts in affected individuals cataracts usually develop in infancy rather than after age 60 as typically occurs in the general population cataracts that are not removed surgically cause progressive dimming and blurriness of vision because the clouded lenses reduce and distort incoming light although the hyperferritinemia in this disorder does not usually cause any health problems other than cataracts the elevated ferritin levels in the blood can be mistaken for a sign of certain liver disorders these conditions result in excess iron in the body and may be treated by blood drawing however individuals with hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome do not have an excess of iron and with repeated blood draws will develop reduced iron levels leading to a low number of red blood cells anemia therefore correct diagnosis of hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome is important to avoid unnecessary treatments or invasive test procedures such as liver biopsies,"cataract, anemia",,,"Cataract, Anemia",,

the genetic causes of russell silver syndrome are complex the disorder often results from the abnormal regulation of certain genes that control growth research has focused on genes located in particular regions of chromosome 7 and chromosome 11 people normally inherit one copy of each chromosome from their mother and one copy from their father for most genes both copies are expressed or turned on in cells for some genes however only the copy inherited from a person s father the paternal copy is expressed for other genes only the copy inherited from a person s mother the maternal copy is expressed these parent specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting both chromosome 7 and chromosome 11 contain groups of genes that normally undergo genomic imprinting abnormalities involving these genes appear to be responsible for many cases of russell silver syndrome researchers suspect that at least one third of all cases of russell silver syndrome result from changes in a process called methylation methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of dna in genes that undergo genomic imprinting methylation is one way that a gene s parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells russell silver syndrome has been associated with changes in methylation involving the h19 and igf2 genes which are located near one another on chromosome 11 these genes are thought to be involved in directing normal growth a loss of methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes which leads to slow growth and the other characteristic features of this disorder abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 7 also cause russell silver syndrome in 7 percent to 10 percent of cases people inherit both copies of chromosome 7 from their mother instead of one copy from each parent this phenomenon is called maternal uniparental disomy upd maternal upd causes people to have two active copies of maternally expressed imprinted genes rather than one active copy from the mother and one inactive copy from the father these individuals do not have a paternal copy of chromosome 7 and therefore do not have any copies of genes that are active only on the paternal copy in cases of russell silver syndrome caused by maternal upd an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 7 underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder in at least 40 percent of people with russell silver syndrome the cause of the condition is unknown it is possible that changes in chromosomes other than 7 and 11 may play a role researchers are working to identify additional genetic changes that underlie this disorder,,,,Russell-Silver syndrome,,

blood tests are used to diagnosis diabetes and prediabetes because early in the disease type 2 diabetes may have no symptoms all diabetes blood tests involve drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis lab analysis of blood is needed to ensure test results are accurate glucose measuring devices used in a health care providers office such as finger stick devices are not accurate enough for diagnosis but may be used as a quick indicator of high blood glucose testing enables health care providers to find and treat diabetes before complications occur and to find and treat prediabetes which can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes from developing any one of the following tests can be used for diagnosis an a1c test also called the hemoglobin a1c hba1c or glycohemoglobin test a fasting plasma glucose fpg test an oral glucose tolerance test ogtt not all tests are recommended for diagnosing all types of diabetes see the individual test descriptions for details another blood test the random plasma glucose rpg test is sometimes used to diagnose diabetes during a regular health checkup if the rpg measures 200 milligrams per deciliter or above and the individual also shows symptoms of diabetes then a health care provider may diagnose diabetes symptoms of diabetes include increased urination increased thirst unexplained weight loss other symptoms can include fatigue blurred vision increased hunger and sores that do not heal any test used to diagnose diabetes requires confirmation with a second measurement unless clear symptoms of diabetes exist the following table provides the blood test levels for diagnosis of diabetes for nonpregnant adults and diagnosis of prediabetes a1c test the a1c test is used to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes but is not recommended for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes the a1c test is a blood test that reflects the average of a persons blood glucose levels over the past 3 months and does not show daily fluctuations the a1c test is more convenient for patients than the traditional glucose tests because it does not require fasting and can be performed at any time of the day the a1c test result is reported as a percentage the higher the percentage the higher a persons blood glucose levels have been a normal a1c level is below 5 7 percent an a1c of 5 7 to 6 4 percent indicates prediabetes people diagnosed with prediabetes may be retested in 1 year people with an a1c below 5 7 percent maystill be at risk for diabetes depending on the presence of other characteristics that put them at risk also known as risk factors people with an a1c above 6 0 percent should be considered at very high risk of developing diabetes a level of 6 5 percent or above means a person has diabetes laboratory analysis when the a1c test is used for diagnosis the blood sample must be sent to a laboratory using a method that is certified by the ngsp to ensure the results are standardized blood samples analyzed in a health care providers office known as point of care tests are not standardized for diagnosing diabetes abnormal results the a1c test can be unreliable for diagnosing or monitoring diabetes in people with certain conditions known to interfere with the results interference should be suspected when a1c results seem very different from the results of a blood glucose test people of african mediterranean or southeast asian descent or people with family members with sickle cell anemia or a thalassemia are particularly at risk of

information about the a1c test is provided in the niddk health topic the a1c test and diabetes or by calling 18008608747 fasting plasma glucose test the fpg test is used to detect diabetes and prediabetes the fpg test has been the most common test used for diagnosing diabetes because it is more convenient than the ogtt and less expensive the fpg test measures blood glucose in a person who has fasted for at least 8 hours and is most reliable when given in the morning people with a fasting glucose level of 100 to 125 mg dl have impaired fasting glucose ifg or prediabetes a level of 126 mg dl or above confirmed by repeating the test on another day means a person has diabetes oral glucose tolerance test the ogtt can be used to diagnose diabetes prediabetes and gestational diabetes research has shown that the ogtt is more sensitive than the fpg test but it is less convenient to administer when used to test for diabetes or prediabetes the ogtt measures blood glucose after a person fasts for at least 8 hours and 2 hours after the person drinks a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water if the 2 hour blood glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg dl the person has a type of prediabetes called impaired glucose tolerance igt if confirmed by a second test a 2 hour glucose level of 200 mg dl or above means a person has diabetes,"diabetes, prediabetes,

mutations in the wrn gene cause werner syndrome the wrn gene provides instructions for producing the werner protein which is thought to perform several tasks related to the maintenance and repair of dna this protein also assists in the process of copying replicating dna in preparation for cell division mutations in the wrn gene often lead to the production of an abnormally short nonfunctional werner protein research suggests that this shortened protein is not transported to the cell s nucleus where it normally interacts with dna evidence also suggests that the altered protein is broken down more quickly in the cell than the normal werner protein researchers do not fully understand how wrn mutations cause the signs and symptoms of werner syndrome cells with an altered werner protein may divide more slowly or stop dividing earlier than normal causing growth problems also the altered protein may allow dna damage to accumulate which could impair normal cell activities and cause the health problems associated with this condition,,,,,,

how is lesch nyhan syndrome inherited lesch nyhan syndrome is inherited in an x linked recessive manner a condition is x linked if the changed mutated gene responsible for the condition is located on the x chromosome the x chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes females have two x chromosomes and males have one x and one y chromosome females who have one mutated copy of the responsible gene on one of their x chromosomes usually do not have the condition and are referred to as carriers this is because they still have a working copy of the responsible gene on their other x chromosome males with one mutated copy of the responsible gene have signs and symptoms of the condition they are affected because they do not have another x chromosome with a working copy of the gene this is why x linked recessive disorders including lesch nyhan syndrome occur much more frequently in males lesch nyhan syndrome is caused by mutations in the hprt1 gene a female who is a carrier of lesch nyhan syndrome has a 50 chance of passing on the mutated hprt1 gene in each pregnancy this is because a carrier female will randomly pass on one of her x chromosome to each child sons who inherit the mutated gene will be affected and daughters who inherit the mutated gene will be carriers this means that with each pregnancy a female who is a carrier has a 50 1 in 2 chance of having an unaffected son or daughter 25 1 in 4 chance of having an affected son 25 chance of having a carrier daughter,,,,Lesch Nyhan syndrome,,
rabson mendenhall syndrome results from mutations in the insr gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called an insulin receptor which is found in many types of cells insulin receptors are embedded in the outer membrane surrounding the cell where they attach bind to insulin circulating in the bloodstream this binding triggers signaling pathways that influence many cell functions the insr gene mutations that cause rabson mendenhall syndrome reduce the number of insulin receptors that reach the cell membrane or diminish the function of these receptors although insulin is present in the bloodstream without enough functional receptors it is less able to exert its effects on cells and tissues this severe resistance to the effects of insulin impairs blood sugar regulation and affects many aspects of development in people with rabson mendenhall syndrome,,,,Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome,,

fecal incontinence has many causes including diarrhea constipation muscle damage or weakness nerve damage loss of stretch in the rectum childbirth by vaginal delivery hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse rectocele inactivity diarrhea diarrhea can cause fecal incontinence loose stools fill the rectum quickly and are more difficult to hold than solid stools diarrhea increases the chance of not reaching a bathroom in time constipation constipation can lead to large hard stools that stretch the rectum and cause the internal sphincter muscles to relax by reflex watery stool builds up behind the hard stool and may leak out around the hard stool leading to fecal incontinence the type of constipation that is most likely to lead to fecal incontinence occurs when people are unable to relax their external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles when straining to have a bowel movement often mistakenly squeezing these muscles instead of relaxing them this squeezing makes it difficult to pass stool and may lead to a large amount of stool in the rectum this type of constipation called dyssynergic defecation or disordered defecation is a result of faulty learning for example children or adults who have pain when having a bowel movement may unconsciously learn to squeeze their muscles to delay the bowel movement and avoid pain muscle damage or weakness injury to one or both of the sphincter muscles can cause fecal incontinence if these muscles called the external and internal anal sphincter muscles are damaged or weakened they may not be strong enough to keep the anus closed and prevent stool from leaking trauma childbirth injuries cancer surgery and hemorrhoid surgery are possible causes of injury to the sphincters hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum nerve damage the anal sphincter muscles wont open and close properly if the nerves that control them are damaged likewise if the nerves that sense stool in the rectum are damaged a person may not feel the urge to go to the bathroom both types of nerve damage can lead to fecal incontinence possible sources of nerve damage are childbirth a long term habit of straining to pass stool spinal cord injury and diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis that affect the nerves that go to the sphincter muscles and rectum brain injuries from stroke head trauma or certain diseases can also cause fecal incontinence loss of stretch in the rectum normally the rectum stretches to hold stool until a person has a bowel movement rectal surgery radiation treatment and inflammatory bowel diseaseschronic disorders that cause irritation and sores on the lining of the digestive systemcan cause the rectal walls to become stiff the rectum then cant stretch as much to hold stool increasing the risk of fecal incontinence childbirth by vaginal delivery childbirth sometimes causes injuries to muscles and nerves in the pelvic floor the risk is greater if forceps are used to help deliver the baby or if an episiotomya cut in the vaginal area to prevent the babys head from tearing the vagina during birthis performed fecal incontinence related to childbirth can appear soon after delivery or many years later hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse external hemorrhoids which develop under the skin around the anus can prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing completely rectal prolapse a condition that causes the rectum to drop down through the anus can also prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing well enough to prevent leakage small amounts of mucus or liquid stool can then leak through the anus rectocele rectocele is a condition that causes the rectum to protrude through the vagina rectocele can happen when the thin layer of muscles separating the rectum from the vagina becomes weak for women with rectocele straining to have a bowel movement may be less effective because rectocele reduces the amount of downward force through the anus the result may be retention of stool in the rectum more research is needed to be sure rectocele increases the risk of fecal incontinence inactivity people who are inactive especially those who spend many hours a day sitting or lying down have an increased risk of retaining a large amount of stool in the rectum liquid stool can then leak around the more solid stool frail older adults are most likely to develop constipation related fecal incontinence for this reason,"diarrhea, constipation, hemorrhoids, pain, cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, stroke","childbirth, surgery",,"Diabetes, Stroke, Diarrhea, Hemorrhoids, Constipation, Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, Pain","Surgery, Childbirth",

glycogen storage disease type v also known as gsdv or mcardle disease is an inherited disorder caused by an inability to break down a complex sugar called glycogen in muscle cells a lack of glycogen breakdown interferes with the function of muscle cells people with gsdv typically experience fatigue muscle pain and cramps during the first few minutes of exercise exercise intolerance exercise such as weight lifting or jogging usually triggers these symptoms in affected individuals the discomfort is generally alleviated with rest if individuals rest after brief exercise and wait for their pain to go away they can usually resume exercising with little or no discomfort a characteristic phenomenon known as second wind prolonged or intense exercise can cause muscle damage in people with gsdv about half of people with gsdv experience breakdown of muscle tissue rhabdomyolysis in severe episodes the destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin which is filtered through the kidneys and released in the urine myoglobinuria myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown this protein can also damage the kidneys and it is estimated that half of those individuals with gsdv who have myoglobinuria will develop life threatening kidney failure the signs and symptoms of gsdv can vary significantly in affected individuals the features of this condition typically begin in a person s teens or twenties but they can appear anytime from infancy to adulthood in most people with gsdv the muscle weakness worsens over time however in about one third of affected individuals the muscle weakness is stable some people with gsdv experience mild symptoms such as poor stamina others do not experience any symptoms,"glycogen storage disease type v, fatigue, pain, kidney failure",,,"Fatigue, Kidney Failure, Pain",,
coffin siris syndrome is a condition that affects several body systems although there are many variable signs and symptoms hallmarks of this condition include developmental disability abnormalities of the fifth pinky fingers or toes and characteristic facial features most affected individuals have mild to severe intellectual disability or delayed development of speech and motor skills such as sitting and walking another feature of coffin siris syndrome is underdevelopment hypoplasia of the tips of the fingers or toes or hypoplasia or absence of the nails these abnormalities are most common on the fifth fingers or toes in addition most affected individuals have facial features described as coarse these typically include a wide nose with a flat nasal bridge a wide mouth with thick lips and thick eyebrows and eyelashes affected individuals can have excess hair on other parts of the face and body hirsutism but scalp hair is often sparse there is a range of facial features seen in people with coffin siris syndrome and not all affected individuals have the typical features in addition people with this condition may have an abnormally small head microcephaly additionally some infants and children with coffin siris syndrome have frequent respiratory infections difficulty feeding and an inability to gain weight at the expected rate failure to thrive other signs and symptoms that may occur in people with this condition include short stature low muscle tone hypotonia and abnormally loose lax joints abnormalities of the eyes brain heart and kidneys may also be present,microcephaly,,,"Coffin-Siris syndrome, Microcephaly",,
mutations in the rb1 gene are responsible for most cases of retinoblastoma rb1 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it normally regulates cell growth and keeps cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way most mutations in the rb1 gene prevent it from making any functional protein so it is unable to regulate cell division effectively as a result certain cells in the retina can divide uncontrollably to form a cancerous tumor some studies suggest that additional genetic changes can influence the development of retinoblastoma these changes may help explain variations in the development and growth of tumors in different people a small percentage of retinoblastomas are caused by deletions in the region of chromosome 13 that contains the rb1 gene because these chromosomal changes involve several genes in addition to rb1 affected children usually also have intellectual disability slow growth and distinctive facial features such as prominent eyebrows a short nose with a broad nasal bridge and ear abnormalities,retinoblastoma,,,Retinoblastoma,,

taste or gustation is one of our most robust senses although there is a small decline in taste in people over 60 most older people will not notice it because normal aging does not greatly affect our sense of taste problems with taste occur less frequently than problems with smell how our sense of taste works our sense of taste along with our sense of smell is part of our chemical sensing system normal taste occurs when tiny molecules released by chewing or the digestion of food stimulate special sensory cells in the mouth and throat these taste cells or gustatory cells send messages through three specialized taste nerves to the brain where specific tastes are identified damage to these nerves following head injury can lead to taste loss the taste cells are clustered within the taste buds of the tongue and roof of the mouth and along the lining of the throat many of the small bumps that can be seen on the tip of the tongue contain taste buds at birth we have about 10 000 taste buds scattered on the back sides and tip of the tongue after age 50 we may start to lose taste buds five taste sensations we can experience five basic taste sensations sweet sour bitter salty and umami or savory umami is the taste we get from glutamate a building block of protein found in chicken broth meat stock and some cheeses umami is also the taste associated wtih msg monosodium glutamate that is often added to foods as a flavor enhancer the five taste qualities combine with other oral sensations such as texture spiciness temperature and aroma to produce what is commonly referred to as flavor it is flavor that lets us know whether we are eating an apple or a pear flavors and the sense of smell many people are surprised to learn that we recognize flavors largely through our sense of smell try holding your nose while eating chocolate you will be able to distinguish between its sweetness and bitterness but you can t identify the chocolate flavor that s because the distinguishing characteristic of chocolate is largely identified by our sense of smell as aromas are released during chewing food flavor is affected by a head cold or nasal congestion because the aroma of food does not reach the sensory cells that detect odors more information on this topic can be found in the topic problems with smell smell and taste closely linked smell and taste are closely linked senses many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste when they are really experiencing a problem with smell it is common for people who lose their sense of smell to say that food has lost its taste this is incorrect the food has lost its aroma but taste remains in older people there is a normal decline in the sense of smell and the taste of food shifts toward blandness this is why people often believe they have a taste problem when taste is impaired problems with taste can have a big impact on an older person s life because taste affects the amount and type of food we eat when there are problems with taste a person may change his or her eating habits some people may eat too much and gain weight while others may eat too little and lose weight a loss of appetite especially in older adults can lead to loss of weight poor nutrition weakened immunity and even death taste helps us detect spoiled food or liquids and it also helps some people detect ingredients they are allergic to a problem with taste can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted a distorted sense of taste can be a serious risk factor for illnesses that require sticking to a specific diet loss of taste can cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better this can be a problem for people with such illnesses as diabetes or high blood pressure in severe cases loss of taste can lead to depression taste problems are often temporary when an older person has a problem with taste it is often temporary and minor true taste disorders are uncommon when a problem with taste exists it is usually caused by medications disease some cancer treatments or injury many older people believe that there is nothing they can do about their weakened sense of taste if you think you have a problem with your sense of taste see your doctor depending on the cause of your problem your doctor may be able to suggest ways to regain your sense of taste or to cope with the loss of taste,"diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, cancer",,,"High Blood Pressure, Problems with Taste, Diabetes, Depression, Problems with Smell, Cancer",,

mutations in the mecp2 gene cause ppm x syndrome the mecp2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mecp2 that is critical for normal brain function researchers believe that this protein has several functions including regulating other genes in the brain by switching them off when they are not needed the mecp2 protein likely plays a role in maintaining connections synapses between nerve cells the mecp2 protein may also control the production of different versions of certain proteins in nerve cells although mutations in the mecp2 gene disrupt the normal function of nerve cells it is unclear how these mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of ppm x syndrome some mecp2 gene mutations that cause ppm x syndrome disrupt attachment binding of the mecp2 protein to dna and other mutations alter the 3 dimensional shape of the protein these mutations lead to the production of a mecp2 protein that cannot properly interact with dna or other proteins and so cannot control the expression of genes it is unclear how mecp2 gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of ppm x syndrome but misregulation of genes in the brain likely plays a role,,,,PPM-X syndrome,,

familial isolated hyperparathyroidism can be caused by mutations in the men1 cdc73 or casr gene the men1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called menin menin acts as a tumor suppressor which means it normally keeps cells from growing and dividing proliferating too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way in familial isolated hyperparathyroidism men1 gene mutations result in an altered menin protein that is no longer able to control cell growth and division the resulting increase in cell proliferation leads to the formation of an adenoma involving one or more parathyroid glands overproduction of parathyroid hormone from these abnormal glands stimulates the release of excess calcium into the blood leading to the signs and symptoms of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism it is unclear why this condition affects only the parathyroid glands the cdc73 gene provides instructions for making the parafibromin protein which is also thought to act as a tumor suppressor parafibromin is likely involved in regulating the activity of other genes gene transcription and in cell proliferation cdc73 gene mutations that cause familial isolated hyperparathyroidism likely result in decreased activity of the parafibromin protein the loss of parafibromin s tumor suppressor function can lead to the development of parathyroid adenoma or rarely parathyroid carcinoma the casr gene provides instructions for producing a protein called the calcium sensing receptor casr which helps regulate the amount of calcium in the body in part by controlling the production of parathyroid hormone calcium molecules attach bind to casr turning on activating the receptor when calcium binds to the casr protein in cells of the parathyroid gland the activated receptor sends signals that block the production and release of parathyroid hormone without parathyroid hormone calcium is not released into the blood casr gene mutations associated with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism lead to the production of a less sensitive casr that requires an abnormally high concentration of calcium to trigger signaling as a result parathyroid hormone is produced even when the concentration of calcium in the blood is elevated allowing the calcium levels to continue to rise a small number of individuals with casr related familial isolated hyperparathyroidism have enlarged parathyroid glands and overproduction of parathyroid hormone from these abnormal glands further contributes to the elevated calcium levels in the bloodstream the excess calcium causes the characteristic features of this condition mutations in the men1 gene and the cdc73 gene are involved in other conditions in which hyperparathyroidism is just one of many features however some people with mutations in these genes have only signs and symptoms related to hyperparathyroidism isolated hyperparathyroidism without the additional features of these other conditions while some individuals later develop additional signs and symptoms of the other conditions others do not familial isolated hyperparathyroidism may be a milder variant or early form of the other conditions in many individuals with the signs and symptoms of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism a mutation in the men1 cdc73 or casr gene has not been identified indicating that other genes may be involved in this condition the genetic cause of these cases is unknown,familial isolated hyperparathyroidism,,,Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism,,

mutations in the fgf23 galnt3 or kl gene cause hftc the proteins produced from these genes are all involved in the regulation of phosphate levels within the body phosphate homeostasis among its many functions phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys the kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed the fgf23 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 which is produced in bone cells and signals the kidneys to stop reabsorbing phosphate the proteins produced from the galnt3 and kl genes help to regulate fibroblast growth factor 23 the protein produced from the galnt3 gene called ppgalnact3 attaches sugar molecules to fibroblast growth factor 23 in a process called glycosylation glycosylation allows fibroblast growth factor 23 to move out of the cell and protects the protein from being broken down once outside the bone cell fibroblast growth factor 23 must attach bind to a receptor protein that spans the membrane of kidney cells the protein produced from the kl gene called alpha klotho turns on activates the receptor protein so that fibroblast growth factor 23 can bind to it binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 to its receptor stimulates signaling that stops phosphate reabsorption into the bloodstream mutations in the fgf23 galnt3 or kl gene lead to a disruption in fibroblast growth factor 23 signaling fgf23 gene mutations result in the production of a protein with decreased function that quickly gets broken down mutations in the galnt3 gene result in the production of ppgalnact3 protein with little or no function as a result the protein cannot glycosylate fibroblast growth factor 23 which is consequently trapped inside the cell and broken down rather than being released from the cell secreted kl gene mutations lead to a shortage of functional alpha klotho as a result the receptor protein is not activated causing it to be unavailable to be bound to fibroblast growth factor 23 all of these impairments to fibroblast growth factor 23 function and signaling lead to increased phosphate absorption by the kidneys calcinosis results when the excess phosphate combines with calcium to form deposits that build up in soft tissues although phosphate levels are increased calcium is typically within the normal range,,,,,,

this condition is not inherited it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells eggs and sperm an error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes in 48 xxyy syndrome the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes one x and two y chromosomes if that sperm cell fertilizes a normal egg cell with one x chromosome the resulting child will have two x chromosomes and two y chromosomes in each of the body s cells in a small percentage of cases 48 xxyy syndrome results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes in a 46 xy embryo very soon after fertilization has occurred this means that an normal sperm cell with one y chromosome fertilized a normal egg cell with one x chromosome but right after fertilization nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes caused the embryo to gain two extra sex chromosomes resulting in a 48 xxyy embryo,,,,"48,XXYY syndrome",,

treatment are being tested in clinical trials high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant new treatment options patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell tumors different types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian germ cell tumor some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment four types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery is the most common treatment of ovarian germ cell tumor a doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following types of surgery unilateral salpingo oophorectomy a surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube total hysterectomy a surgical procedure to remove the uterus including the cervix if the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision cut in the abdomen the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision cut in the abdomen using a laparoscope the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy bilateral salpingo oophorectomy a surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes tumor debulking a surgical procedure in which as much of the tumor as possible is removed some tumors cannot be completely removed even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation some patients may be offered chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy after chemotherapy for an ovarian germ cell tumor a second look laparotomy may be done this is similar to the laparotomy that is done to find out the stage of the cancer second look laparotomy is a surgical procedure to find out if tumor cells are left after primary treatment during this procedure the doctor will take samples of lymph nodes and other tissues in the abdomen to see if any cancer is left this procedure is not done for dysgerminomas observation observation is closely watching a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer for more information radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat ovarian germ cell tumors new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant is a method of giving very high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells new treatment options combination chemotherapy the use of more than one anticancer drug is being tested in clinical trials patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes

tumors are abnormal growths in your body they are made up of extra cells normally cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them when cells grow old they die and new cells take their place sometimes this process goes wrong new cells form when your body does not need them and old cells do not die when they should when these extra cells form a mass it is called a tumor tumors can be either benign or malignant benign tumors aren t cancer malignant ones are benign tumors grow only in one place they cannot spread or invade other parts of your body even so they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs such as your brain treatment often involves surgery benign tumors usually don t grow back nih national cancer institute,"benign tumors, cancer",surgery,,"Benign Tumors, Cancer",Surgery,

cartilage hair hypoplasia is caused by mutations in the rmrp gene unlike many genes the rmrp gene does not contain instructions for making a protein instead a molecule called a noncoding rna a chemical cousin of dna is produced from the rmrp gene this rna attaches binds to several proteins forming an enzyme complex called mitochondrial rna processing endoribonuclease or rnase mrp the rnase mrp enzyme is thought to be involved in several important processes in the cell for example it likely helps copy replicate the dna found in the energy producing centers of cells mitochondria the rnase mrp enzyme probably also processes ribosomal rna which is required for assembling protein building blocks amino acids into functioning proteins in addition this enzyme helps control the cell cycle which is the cell s way of replicating itself in an organized step by step fashion mutations in the rmrp gene likely result in the production of a noncoding rna that is unstable this unstable molecule cannot bind to some of the proteins needed to make the rnase mrp enzyme complex these changes are believed to affect the activity of the enzyme which interferes with its important functions within cells disruption of the rnase mrp enzyme complex causes the signs and symptoms of cartilage hair hypoplasia,cartilage hair hypoplasia,,,,,
key points there are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended six types of treatment are used surgery observation radiation therapy chemotherapy high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant targeted therapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials other drug therapy if fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma different types of treatment are available for children with astrocytomas some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists pediatrician pediatric neurosurgeon neurologist neuropathologist neuroradiologist rehabilitation specialist radiation oncologist endocrinologist psychologist childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis these signs or symptoms may continue for months or years it is important to talk with your child s doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include the following physical problems changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory second cancers new types of cancer some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your child s doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information six types of treatment are used surgery surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood astrocytoma as discussed in the general information section of this summary if cancer cells remain after surgery further treatment depends on where the remaining cancer cells are the grade of the tumor the age of the child even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy observation observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change observation may be used if the patient has no symptoms such as patients with neurofibromatosis type1 if the tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated after the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue these types of radiation therapy include the following conformal radiation therapy conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3 dimensional 3 d picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt imrt is a type of 3 dimensional 3 d external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor thin beams of radiation of different intensities strengths are aimed at the tumor from many angles stereotactic radiation therapy stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy a rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment a machine aims radiation directly at the tumor the total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days this procedure is also called stereotactic external beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy proton beam radiation therapy proton beam therapy is a type of high energy external radiation therapy a radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons tiny invisible positively charged particles at the cancer cells to kill them internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord external radiation therapy is used to treat childhood astrocytomas radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development especially in young children for children younger than 3 years chemotherapy may be given instead to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord systemic combination chemotherapy is used in the treatment of children with astrocytoma high dose chemotherapy may be used in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed high grade astrocytoma high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the body s blood cells for high grade astrocytoma that has come back after treatment high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is used if there is only a small amount of tumor targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells there are different types of targeted therapy monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell to stop cancer cells these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion into a vein they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells there are different types of monoclonal antibody therapy vascular endothelial growth factor vegf inhibitor therapy cancer cells make a substance called vegf which causes new blood vessels to form angiogenesis and helps the cancer grow vegf inhibitors block vegf and stop new blood vessels from forming this may kill cancer cells because they need new blood vessels to grow bevacizumab is a vegf inhibitor and angiogenesis inhibitor being used to treat childhood astrocytoma immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy pd 1 is a protein on the surface of t cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check when pd 1 attaches to another protein called pdl 1 on a cancer cell it stops the t cell from killing the cancer cell pd 1 inhibitors attach to pdl 1 and allow the t cells to kill cancer cells pd 1 inhibitors are being studied to treat high grade astrocytoma that has recurred protein kinase inhibitors work in different ways there are several kinds of protein kinase inhibitors mtor inhibitors stop cells from dividing and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow everolimus and sirolimus are mtor inhibitors used to treat childhood subependymal giant cell astrocytomas mtor inhibitors also are being studied to treat low grade astrocytoma that has recurred braf inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells the braf inhibitor dabrafenib is being studied to treat low grade astrocytoma that has recurred vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been used to treat high grade astrocytomas that have recurred but more study is needed to know how well they work in children mek inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells mek inhibitors such as selumetinib are being studied to treat low grade astrocytoma that has recurred see drugs approved for brain tumors for more information new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website other drug therapy lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor it prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow if fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up around the brain and spinal cord a shunt long thin tube is placed in a ventricle fluid filled space of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body usually the abdomen the shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated see the general information section for a list of tests some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests regular mris will continue to be done after treatment has ended the results of the mri can show if your child s condition has changed or if the astrocytoma has recurred come back if the results of the mri show a mass in the brain a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing treatment options for childhood astrocytomas newly diagnosed childhood low grade astrocytomas when the tumor is first diagnosed treatment for childhood low grade astrocytoma depends on where the tumor is and is usually surgery an mri is done after surgery to see if there is tumor remaining if the tumor was completely removed by surgery more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely watched to see if signs or symptoms appear or change this is called observation if there is tumor remaining after surgery treatment may include the following observation a second surgery to remove the tumor radiation therapy which may include conformal radiation therapy intensity modulated radiation therapy proton beam radiation therapy or stereotactic radiation therapy when the tumor begins to grow again combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy in some cases observation is used for children who have a visual pathway glioma in other cases treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor radiation therapy or chemotherapy a goal of treatment is to save as much vision as possible the effect of tumor growth on the child s vision will be closely followed during treatment children with neurofibromatosis type 1 nf1 may not need treatment unless the tumor grows or signs or symptoms such as

a variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing androgenetic alopecia although researchers are studying risk factors that may contribute to this condition most of these factors remain unknown researchers have determined that this form of hair loss is related to hormones called androgens particularly an androgen called dihydrotestosterone androgens are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty androgens also have other important functions in both males and females such as regulating hair growth and sex drive hair growth begins under the skin in structures called follicles each strand of hair normally grows for 2 to 6 years goes into a resting phase for several months and then falls out the cycle starts over when the follicle begins growing a new hair increased levels of androgens in hair follicles can lead to a shorter cycle of hair growth and the growth of shorter and thinner strands of hair additionally there is a delay in the growth of new hair to replace strands that are shed although researchers suspect that several genes play a role in androgenetic alopecia variations in only one gene ar have been confirmed in scientific studies the ar gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to dihydrotestosterone and other androgens studies suggest that variations in the ar gene lead to increased activity of androgen receptors in hair follicles it remains unclear however how these genetic changes increase the risk of hair loss in men and women with androgenetic alopecia researchers continue to investigate the connection between androgenetic alopecia and other medical conditions such as coronary heart disease and prostate cancer in men and polycystic ovary syndrome in women they believe that some of these disorders may be associated with elevated androgen levels which may help explain why they tend to occur with androgen related hair loss other hormonal environmental and genetic factors that have not been identified also may be involved,"hair loss, falls, prostate cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome",,,"Prostate Cancer, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Cancer, Falls, Hair Loss",,

tests that examine the small intestine are used to detect find diagnose and stage small intestine cancer procedures that make pictures of the small intestine and the area around it help diagnose small intestine cancer and show how far the cancer has spread the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the small intestine is called staging in order to plan treatment it is important to know the type of small intestine cancer and whether the tumor can be removed by surgery tests and procedures to detect diagnose and stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time the following tests and procedures may be used physical exam and history an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken blood chemistry studies a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease liver function tests a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver a higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by small intestine cancer endoscopy a procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas there are different types of endoscopy upper endoscopy a procedure to look at the inside of the esophagus stomach and duodenum first part of the small intestine near the stomach an endoscope is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus stomach and duodenum an endoscope is a thin tube like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer capsule endoscopy a procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine a capsule that is about the size of a large pill and contains a light and a tiny wireless camera is swallowed by the patient the capsule travels through the digestive tract including the small intestine and sends many pictures of the inside of the digestive tract to a recorder that is worn around the waist or over the shoulder the pictures are sent from the recorder to a computer and viewed by the doctor who checks for signs of cancer the capsule passes out of the body during a bowel movement double balloon endoscopy a procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine a special instrument made up of two tubes one inside the other is inserted through the mouth or rectum and into the small intestine the inside tube an endoscope with a light and lens for viewing is moved through part of the small intestine and a balloon at the end of it is inflated to keep the endoscope in place next the outer tube is moved through the small intestine to reach the end of the endoscope and a balloon at the end of the outer tube is inflated to keep it in place then the balloon at the end of the endoscope is deflated and the endoscope is moved through the next part of the small intestine these steps are repeated many times as the tubes move through the small intestine the doctor is able to see the inside of the small intestine through the endoscope and use a tool to remove samples of abnormal tissue the tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure may be done if the results of a capsule endoscopy are abnormal this procedure is also called double balloon enteroscopy laparotomy a surgical procedure in which an incision cut is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease the size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done sometimes organs or lymph nodes are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease biopsy the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer this may be done during an endoscopy or laparotomy the sample is checked by a pathologist to see if it contains cancer cells upper gi series with small bowel follow through a series of x rays of the esophagus stomach and small bowel the

being tested in clinical trials biologic therapy radiation therapy with radiosensitizers patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with small intestine cancer different types of treatments are available for patients with small intestine cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment three types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery is the most common treatment of small intestine cancer one of the following types of surgery may be done resection surgery to remove part or all of an organ that contains cancer the resection may include the small intestine and nearby organs if the cancer has spread the doctor may remove the section of the small intestine that contains cancer and perform an anastomosis joining the cut ends of the intestine together the doctor will usually remove lymph nodes near the small intestine and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer bypass surgery to allow food in the small intestine to go around bypass a tumor that is blocking the intestine but cannot be removed even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat small intestine cancer chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient s immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the body s natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy radiation therapy with radiosensitizers radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up

desmosterolosis is caused by mutations in the dhcr24 gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 24 dehydrocholesterol reductase which is involved in the production synthesis of cholesterol cholesterol is a waxy fat like substance that can be obtained from foods that come from animals particularly egg yolks meat poultry fish and dairy products it can also be produced in various tissues in the body for example the brain cannot access the cholesterol that comes from food so brain cells must produce their own cholesterol is necessary for normal embryonic development and has important functions both before and after birth dhcr24 gene mutations lead to the production of 24 dehydrocholesterol reductase with reduced activity as a result there is a decrease in cholesterol production because the brain relies solely on cellular production for cholesterol it is most severely affected without adequate cholesterol cell membranes are not formed properly and nerve cells are not protected by myelin leading to the death of these cells in addition a decrease in cholesterol production has more severe effects before birth than during other periods of development because of the rapid increase in cell number that takes place disruption of normal cell formation before birth likely accounts for the additional developmental abnormalities of desmosterolosis,"desmosterolosis, cholesterol",,,"Cholesterol, Desmosterolosis",,

spina bifida is a complex condition that is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors some of these factors have been identified but many remain unknown changes in dozens of genes in individuals with spina bifida and in their mothers may influence the risk of developing this type of neural tube defect the best studied of these genes is mthfr which provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in processing the vitamin folate also called vitamin b9 a shortage deficiency of this vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects changes in other genes related to folate processing and genes involved in the development of the neural tube have also been studied as potential risk factors for spina bifida however none of these genes appears to play a major role in causing the condition researchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of spina bifida as mentioned above folate deficiency appears to play a significant role studies have shown that women who take supplements containing folic acid the synthetic form of folate before they get pregnant and very early in their pregnancy are significantly less likely to have a baby with spina bifida or a related neural tube defect other possible maternal risk factors for spina bifida include diabetes mellitus obesity exposure to high heat such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna in early pregnancy and the use of certain anti seizure medications during pregnancy however it is unclear how these factors may influence the risk of spina bifida,"spina bifida, neural tube defects, diabetes, obesity, fever",,,"Diabetes, Fever, Spina Bifida, Obesity, Neural Tube Defects",,
angiostrongylus cantonensis angiostrongylus cantonensis also known as the rat lungworm is a parasitic nematode worm that is transmitted between rats and mollusks such as slugs or snails in its natural life cycle other animals that become infected such as freshwater shrimp land crabs frogs and planarians of the genus platydemus are transport hosts that are not required for reproduction of the parasite but might be able to transmit infection to humans if eaten raw or undercooked humans are accidental hosts who do not transmit infection to others most cases of infection are diagnosed in southeast asia and the pacific basin but the parasite has also been found in australia some areas of africa the caribbean hawaii and louisiana outbreaks of human angiostrongyliasis have involved a few to hundreds of persons over 2 800 cases have been reported in the literature from approximately 30 countries it is likely that the parasite has been spread by rats transported on ships and by the introduction of mollusks such as the giant african land snail achatina fulica in addition the semi slug parmarion martensi native of southeast asia has spread in regions of hawaii and is found to often be infected with a cantonensis and the freshwater snail pomacea canaliculata native of south america has been introduced into taiwan and china and has been implicated in outbreaks of disease in those countries risk factors for infection with a cantonensis include the ingestion of raw or undercooked infected snails or slugs or pieces of snails and slugs accidentally chopped up in vegetables vegetable juices or salads or foods contaminated by the slime of infected snails or slugs it is possible that ingestion of raw or undercooked transport hosts freshwater shrimp land crabs frogs etc can result in human infection though this is less certain in addition contamination of the hands during the preparation of uncooked infected snails or slugs could lead to ingestion of the parasite angiostrongylus costaricensis angiostrongylus costaricensis is a parasitic nematode worm that resides in rodents and uses mollusks such as slugs as an intermediate host rats such as the cotton rat transmit the larvae through their feces slugs then ingest the larvae humans are accidental hosts of the parasite the parasite is not able to complete its life cycle in humans and eventually dies in the abdomen human infection principally occurs in latin america and the caribbean with a few cases suspected in the united states and in the republic of congo the organism is also found in animals in the southern u s texas risk factors for infection with a costaricensis are not well established but are likely to be ingestion of infected slugs or raw vegetables or vegetable juices contaminated with slugs or their slime which can contain a costaricensis larvae the infection of transport hosts which are not essential to the lifecycle of the parasite has not been identified and any role in human infection is not known in contrast to a cantonensis some reports have shown the case rate to be higher in children 6 to 12 years of age males and in persons of higher socioeconomic status there has been one food related outbreak in guatemala that affected primarily adults,,,,,,

caid is caused by mutations in the sgo1 gene this gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex called cohesin this protein complex helps control the placement of chromosomes during cell division before cells divide they must copy all of their chromosomes the copied dna from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures called sister chromatids which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division cohesin holds the sister chromatids together and in doing so helps maintain the stability of chromosomal structure during cell division researchers suggest that sgo1 gene mutations may result in a cohesin complex that is less able to hold sister chromatids together resulting in decreased chromosomal stability during cell division this instability is thought to cause early aging senescence of cells in the intestinal muscle and in the sa node resulting in problems maintaining proper rhythmic movements of the heart and intestines and leading to the signs and symptoms of caid it is unclear why sgo1 gene mutations specifically affect the heart and intestines in caid researchers suggest that the activity expression of the sgo1 gene in certain embryonic tissues or a particular function of the sgo1 protein in the sa node and in cells that help control peristalsis may account for the features of the disorder,,,,,,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors children with wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended five types of standard treatment are used surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy biologic therapy high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials targeted therapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors different types of treatment are available for children with wilms and other childhood kidney tumors some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment children with wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children your child s treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists pediatrician pediatric surgeon or urologist radiation oncologist rehabilitation specialist pediatric nurse specialist social worker some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include the following physical problems such as heart problems kidney problems or problems during pregnancy changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory second cancers new types of cancer such as cancer of the gastrointestinal tract or breast cancer some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your child s doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child see the pdq summary about late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information clinical trials are being done to find out if lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation can be used to lessen the late effects of treatment without changing how well the treatment works five types of standard treatment are used surgery two types of surgery are used to treat kidney tumors nephrectomy wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are usually treated with nephrectomy surgery to remove the whole kidney nearby lymph nodes may also be removed and checked for signs of cancer sometimes a kidney transplant surgery to remove the kidney and replace it with a kidney from a donor is done when the cancer is in both kidneys and the kidneys are not working well partial nephrectomy if cancer is found in both kidneys or is likely to spread to both kidneys surgery may include a partial nephrectomy removal of the cancer in the kidney and a small amount of normal tissue around it partial nephrectomy is done to keep as much of the kidney working as possible a partial nephrectomy is also called renal sparing surgery even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk of the cancer coming back is called adjuvant therapy sometimes a second look surgery is done to see if cancer remains after chemotherapy or radiation therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether a biopsy was done before surgery to remove the tumor external radiation therapy is used to treat wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated systemic chemotherapy is used to treat wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors sometimes the tumor cannot be removed by surgery for one of the following reasons the tumor is too close to important organs or blood vessels the tumor is too large to remove the cancer is in both kidneys there is a blood clot in the vessels near the liver the patient has trouble breathing because cancer has spread to the lungs in this case a biopsy is done first then chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiation therapy is given after surgery see drugs approved for wilms tumor and other childhood kidney cancers for more information biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient s immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the body s natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy interferon and interleukin 2 il 2 are types of biologic therapy used to treat childhood renal cell cancer interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth il 2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells especially lymphocytes a type of white blood cell lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these re infused stem cells grow into and restore the body s blood cells high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be used to treat recurrent wilms tumor follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your child s condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options for wilms tumor stage i wilms tumor treatment of stage i

treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia may include lifestyle changes medications minimally invasive procedures surgery a health care provider treats benign prostatic hyperplasia based on the severity of symptoms how much the symptoms affect a mans daily life and a mans preferences men may not need treatment for a mildly enlarged prostate unless their symptoms are bothersome and affecting their quality of life in these cases instead of treatment a urologist may recommend regular checkups if benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms become bothersome or present a health risk a urologist most often recommends treatment lifestyle changes a health care provider may recommend lifestyle changes for men whose symptoms are mild or slightly bothersome lifestyle changes can include reducing intake of liquids particularly before going out in public or before periods of sleep avoiding or reducing intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol avoiding or monitoring the use of medications such as decongestants antihistamines antidepressants and diuretics training the bladder to hold more urine for longer periods exercising pelvic floor muscles preventing or treating constipation medications a health care provider or urologist may prescribe medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or reduce symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia alpha blockers phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors 5 alpha reductase inhibitors combination medications alpha blockers these medications relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow and reduce bladder blockage terazosin hytrin doxazosin cardura tamsulosin flomax alfuzosin uroxatral silodosin rapaflo phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors urologists prescribe these medications mainly for erectile dysfunction tadalafil cialis belongs to this class of medications and can reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by relaxing smooth muscles in the lower urinary tract researchers are working to determine the role of erectile dysfunction drugs in the long term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 5 alpha reductase inhibitors these medications block the production of dht which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth finasteride proscar dutasteride avodart these medications can prevent progression of prostate growth or actually shrink the prostate in some men finasteride and dutasteride act more slowly than alpha blockers and are useful for only moderately enlarged prostates combination medications several studies such as the medical therapy of prostatic symptoms mtops study have shown that combining two classes of medications instead of using just one can more effectively improve symptoms urinary flow and quality of life the combinations include finasteride and doxazosin dutasteride and tamsulosin jalyn a combination of both medications that is available in a single tablet alpha blockers and antimuscarinics a urologist may prescribe a combination of alpha blockers and antimuscarinics for patients with overactive bladder symptoms overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause urinary frequency urinary urgency and urinary incontinence antimuscarinics are a class of medications that relax the bladder muscles minimally invasive procedures researchers have developed a number of minimally invasive procedures that relieve benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms when medications prove ineffective these procedures include transurethral needle ablation transurethral microwave thermotherapy high intensity focused ultrasound transurethral electrovaporization water induced thermotherapy prostatic stent insertion minimally invasive procedures can destroy enlarged prostate tissue or widen the urethra which can help relieve blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia urologists perform minimally invasive procedures using the transurethral method which involves inserting a cathetera thin flexible tubeor cystoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate these procedures may require local regional or general anesthesia although destroying troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms tissue destruction does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia a urologist will decide which procedure to perform based on the mans symptoms and overall health transurethral needle ablation this procedure uses heat generated by radiofrequency energy to destroy prostate tissue a urologist inserts a cystoscope through the urethra to the prostate a urologist then inserts small needles through the end of the cystoscope into the prostate the needles send radiofrequency energy that heats and destroys selected portions of prostate tissue shields protect the urethra from heat damage transurethral microwave thermotherapy this procedure uses microwaves to destroy prostate tissue a urologist inserts a catheter through the urethra to the prostate and a device called an antenna sends microwaves through the catheter to heat selected portions of the prostate the temperature becomes high enough inside the prostate to destroy enlarged tissue a cooling system protects the urinary tract from heat damage during the procedure high intensity focused ultrasound for this procedure a urologist inserts a special ultrasound probe into the rectum near the prostate ultrasound waves from the probe heat and destroy enlarged prostate tissue transurethral electrovaporization for this procedure a urologist inserts a tubelike instrument called a resectoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate an electrode attached to the resectoscope moves across the surface of the prostate and transmits an electric current that vaporizes prostate tissue the vaporizing effect penetrates below the surface area being treated and seals blood vessels which reduces the risk of bleeding water induced thermotherapy this procedure uses heated water to destroy prostate tissue a urologist inserts a catheter into the urethra so that a treatment balloon rests in the middle of the prostate heated water flows through the catheter into the treatment balloon which heats and destroys the surrounding prostate tissue the treatment balloon can target a specific region of the prostate while surrounding tissues in the urethra and bladder remain protected prostatic stent insertion this procedure involves a urologist inserting a small device called a prostatic stent through the urethra to the area narrowed by the enlarged prostate once in place the stent expands like a spring and it pushes back the prostate tissue widening the urethra prostatic stents may be temporary or permanent urologists generally use prostatic stents in men who may not tolerate or be suitable for other procedures surgery for long term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia a urologist may recommend removing enlarged prostate tissue or making cuts in the prostate to widen the urethra urologists recommend surgery when medications and minimally invasive procedures are ineffective symptoms are particularly bothersome or severe complications arise although removing troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms tissue removal does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery to remove enlarged prostate tissue includes transurethral resection of the prostate turp laser surgery open prostatectomy transurethral incision of the prostate tuip a urologist performs these surgeries except for open prostatectomy using the transurethral method men who have these surgical procedures require local regional or general anesthesia and may need to stay in the hospital the urologist may prescribe antibiotics before or soon after surgery to prevent infection some urologists prescribe antibiotics only when an infection occurs immediately after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery a urologist may insert a special catheter called a foley catheter through the opening of the penis to drain urine from the bladder into a drainage pouch turp with turp a urologist inserts a resectoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate and cuts pieces of enlarged prostate tissue with a wire loop special fluid carries the tissue pieces into the bladder and the urologist flushes them out at the end of the procedure turp is the most common surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia and considered the gold standard for treating blockage of the urethra due to benign prostatic hyperplasia laser surgery with this surgery a urologist uses a high energy laser to destroy prostate tissue the urologist uses a cystoscope to pass a laser fiber through the urethra into the prostate the laser destroys the enlarged tissue the risk of bleeding is lower than in turp and tuip because the laser seals blood vessels as it cuts through the prostate tissue however laser surgery may not effectively treat greatly enlarged prostates open prostatectomy in an open prostatectomy a urologist makes an incision or cut through the skin to reach the prostate the urologist can remove all or part of the prostate through the incision this surgery is used most often when the prostate is greatly enlarged complications occur or the bladder is damaged and needs repair open prostatectomy requires general anesthesia a longer hospital stay than other surgical procedures for benign prostatic hyperplasia and a longer rehabilitation period the three open prostatectomy procedures are retropubic prostatectomy suprapubic prostatectomy and perineal prostatectomy the recovery period for open prostatectomy is different for each man who undergoes the procedure however it typically takes anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks 4 tuip a tuip is a surgical procedure to widen the urethra during a tuip the urologist inserts a cystoscope and an instrument that uses an electric current or a laser beam through the urethra to reach the prostate the urologist widens the urethra by making a few small cuts in the prostate and in the bladder neck some urologists believe that tuip gives the same relief as turp except with less risk of side effects after surgery the prostate urethra and surrounding tissues may be irritated and swollen causing urinary retention to prevent urinary retention a urologist inserts a foley catheter so urine can drain freely out of the bladder a foley catheter has a balloon on the end that the urologist inserts into the bladder once the balloon is inside the bladder the urologist fills it with sterile water to keep the catheter in place men who undergo minimally invasive procedures may not need a foley catheter the foley catheter most often remains in place for several days sometimes the foley catheter causes recurring painful difficult to control bladder spasms the day after surgery however these spasms will eventually stop a urologist may prescribe medications to relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms these medications include oxybutynin chloride ditropan solifenacin vesicare darifenacin enablex tolterodine detrol hyoscyamine levsin propantheline bromide

how is hypophosphatemic rickets inherited hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an x linked dominant manner this means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the x chromosome and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition because males have only one x chromosome and one y chromosome and females have two x chromosomes x linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently both males and females can have an x linked dominant condition however because males don t have a second working copy of the gene as females do they usually have more severe disease than females if a father has the mutated x linked gene all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene they will all receive his x chromosome none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene they only inherit his y chromosome if a mother has the mutated x linked gene each of her children both male and female has a 50 chance to inherit the mutated gene less commonly hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an x linked recessive autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner,hypophosphatemic rickets,,,"Rickets, Hypophosphatemic rickets",,

are being tested in clinical trials radiation therapy immunotherapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian epithelial cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian epithelial cancer some treatments are standard and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the treatment currently used as standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients with any stage of ovarian cancer may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment three kinds of standard treatment are used surgery most patients have surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible different types of surgery may include hysterectomy surgery to remove the uterus and sometimes the cervix when only the uterus is removed it is called a partial hysterectomy when both the uterus and the cervix are removed it is called a total hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision cut in the abdomen the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision cut in the abdomen using a laparoscope the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy unilateral salpingo oophorectomy a surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube bilateral salpingo oophorectomy a surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes omentectomy a surgical procedure to remove the omentum tissue in the peritoneum that contains blood vessels nerves lymph vessels and lymph nodes lymph node biopsy the removal of all or part of a lymph node a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy a type of regional chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer is intraperitoneal ip chemotherapy in ip chemotherapy the anticancer drugs are carried directly into the peritoneal cavity the space that contains the abdominal organs through a thin tube treatment with more than one anticancer drug is called combination chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer for more information targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be used with chemotherapy to treat ovarian epithelial cancer fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred come back poly adp ribose polymerase inhibitors parp inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block dna repair and may cause cancer cells to die olaparib and niraparib are parp inhibitors that may be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer see drugs approved for ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer for more information new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing some women receive a treatment called intraperitoneal radiation therapy in which radioactive liquid is put directly in the abdomen through a catheter intraperitoneal radiation therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer immunotherapy immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy vaccine therapy uses a substance to stimulate the immune system to destroy a tumor vaccine therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests

diseases can have various causes many things influence your overall health and likelihood of developing a disease sometimes it s not clear what causes a disease many diseases are thought to be caused by a combination of genetic lifestyle and environmental factors the importance of any particular factor varies from person to person if you have a disease does that mean your children and grandchildren will get it too not necessarily they may have a greater chance of developing the disease than someone without a similar family history but they are not certain to get the disease watch

cholesterol high blood pressure pregnancy losses and birth defects stroke learn more about the importance of family history in some of these health problems at diseases genetics and family history center for disease control and prevention heritable diseases some diseases are clearly heritable this means the disease comes from a mutation or harmful change in a gene inherited from one or both parents genes are small structures in your body s cells that determine how you look and tell your body how to work examples of heritable diseases are huntington s disease cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy learn basic information about chromosomes learn basic information about dna role of lifestyle and environment genes are not the only things that cause disease lifestyle habits and environment also play a major part in developing disease diet weight physical activity tobacco and alcohol use occupation and where you live can each increase or decrease disease risk for example smoking increases the chance of developing heart disease and cancer for common diseases like heart disease and cancer habits like smoking or drinking too much alcohol may be more important in causing disease than genes sun exposure is the major known environmental factor associated with the development of skin cancer of all types however other environmental and genetic factors can also increase a persons risk the best defense against skin cancer is to encourage sun protective behaviors regular skin examinations and skin self awareness in an effort to decrease high risk behaviors and optimize early detection of problems learn more about the causes and risk factors for skin cancer clues to your disease risk creating a family health history helps you know about diseases and disease risks it can also show the way a disease occurs in a family for example you may find that a family member had a certain disease at an earlier age than usual 10 to 20 years before most people get it that can increase other family members risk risk also goes up if a relative has a disease that usually does not affect a certain gender for example breast cancer in a man certain combinations of diseases within a family such as breast and ovarian cancer or heart disease and diabetes also increase the chance of developing those diseases some risk factors are not apparent even if they appear healthy people could be at risk for developing a serious disease that runs in the family they could have risk factors that they cannot feel such as high blood pressure they might not even know the disease runs in their family because they ve lost touch with family members with the disease or because other family members with the disease have kept the information private another possibility is that family members who might have developed the disease died young in accidents or by other means they might also be adopted and not share genes with members of their adoptive family getting professional advice family members who think they might be at risk for a disease based on their family health history can ask their health care professionals for advice the professional may order a test to see if the person has the disease or a risk factor for the disease for instance a mammogram can detect possible breast cancer and a colonoscopy can find colon cancer many diseases are more treatable if they are caught early the first step toward better understanding of your family s health is to learn more about the health of close relatives such as parents brothers and sisters and children creating a

in about half of people with dyskeratosis congenita the disorder is caused by mutations in the tert terc dkc1 or tinf2 gene these genes provide instructions for making proteins that help maintain structures known as telomeres which are found at the ends of chromosomes in a small number of individuals with dyskeratosis congenita mutations in other genes involved with telomere maintenance have been identified other affected individuals have no mutations in any of the genes currently associated with dyskeratosis congenita in these cases the cause of the disorder is unknown but other unidentified genes related to telomere maintenance are likely involved telomeres help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down degrading in most cells telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides after a certain number of cell divisions the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self destruct undergo apoptosis telomeres are maintained by two important protein complexes called telomerase and shelterin telomerase helps maintain normal telomere length by adding small repeated segments of dna to the ends of chromosomes each time the cell divides the main components of telomerase called htr and htert are produced from the terc and tert genes respectively the htr component is an rna molecule a chemical cousin of dna it provides a template for creating the repeated sequence of dna that telomerase adds to the ends of chromosomes the function of the htert component is to add the new dna segment to chromosome ends the dkc1 gene provides instructions for making another protein that is important in telomerase function this protein called dyskerin attaches binds to htr and helps stabilize the telomerase complex the shelterin complex helps protect telomeres from the cell s dna repair process without the protection of shelterin the repair mechanism would sense the chromosome ends as abnormal breaks in the dna sequence and either attempt to join the ends together or initiate apoptosis the tinf2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the shelterin complex tert terc dkc1 or tinf2 gene mutations result in dysfunction of the telomerase or shelterin complexes leading to impaired maintenance of telomeres and reduced telomere length cells that divide rapidly are especially vulnerable to the effects of shortened telomeres as a result people with dyskeratosis congenita may experience a variety of problems affecting quickly dividing cells in the body such as cells of the nail beds hair follicles skin lining of the mouth oral mucosa and bone marrow breakage and instability of chromosomes resulting from inadequate telomere maintenance may lead to genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way resulting in the development of cancer in people with dyskeratosis congenita,cancer,,,Cancer,,

mutations in the nlrp7 or khdc3l gene can cause recurrent hydatidiform mole with nlrp7 gene mutations being the most common cause within egg cells oocytes both the nlrp7 and khdc3l proteins are thought to play a role in turning off inactivating certain genes based on which parent the copy of the gene came from a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting for most genes both copies of the gene one copy inherited from each parent are active in all cells for a small subset of genes however only one of the two copies is active for some of these genes the copy from the father is normally active while for others the copy from the mother is normally active the nlrp7 and khdc3l proteins are likely involved in imprinting multiple maternal genes in oocytes ensuring that they will be inactive in the developing embryo the corresponding paternal genes are active nlrp7 or khdc3l gene mutations result in the production of proteins with impaired function as a result multiple genes that contribute to a developing embryo are not imprinted properly leading to abnormal gene activity expression in all pregnancies because many genes that would normally be inactive are instead active embryonic development is impaired resulting in a hydatidiform mole the nlrp7 protein has also been found to play a role in cell growth and division proliferation and cell maturation differentiation research suggests that the nlrp7 protein plays an additional role in immune responses by regulating the release of an immune protein called interleukin 1 beta normally the immune system would recognize a hydatidiform mole as a non growing pregnancy or foreign tissue and signal the body to remove it because the impaired nlrp7 protein slows interleukin 1 beta release the body cannot trigger an immune response to the abnormal pregnancy instead the hydatidiform mole remains in the body the cause of the retention of the pregnancy in women with khdc3l gene mutations is unclear in some cases of recurrent hydatidiform mole no mutations in either of these genes have been identified in these instances the cause of the condition is unknown when there is only a single instance of hydatidiform mole it is often caused by abnormal fertilization of an egg in sporadic hydatidiform mole the embryo either receives genetic information only from sperm cells because the egg has no dna containing nucleus or the embryo receives too much genetic information because two sperm cells fertilized one egg,hydatidiform mole,,,"Hydatidiform mole, Recurrent hydatidiform mole",,

a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer three types of standard treatment are used surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer the medical oncologist works with other doctors who are experts in treating patients with head and neck cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine and rehabilitation patients who have paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer may need special help adjusting to breathing problems or other side effects of the cancer and its treatment if a large amount of tissue or bone around the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity is taken out plastic surgery may be done to repair or rebuild the area the treatment team may include the following specialists radiation oncologist neurologist oral surgeon or head and neck surgeon plastic surgeon dentist nutritionist speech and language pathologist rehabilitation specialist three types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery removing the cancer in an operation is a common treatment for all stages of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer a doctor may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue and bone around the cancer if the cancer has spread the doctor may remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer the total dose of radiation therapy is sometimes divided into several smaller equal doses delivered over a period of several days this is called fractionation internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer external radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works the thyroid hormone levels in the blood may be tested before and after treatment chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer is a type of head and neck cancer new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials information about clinical trials is available from the nci website patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show

during the early stages of leukemia there may be no symptoms many of the symptoms of leukemia don t become apparent until a large number of normal blood cells are crowded out by leukemia cells symptoms of chronic and acute leukemia in chronic leukemia symptoms develop gradually and in the beginning are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia chronic leukemia is usually found during a routine doctor s exam before symptoms are present when symptoms appear they generally are mild at first and gradually get worse but sometimes they don t worsen until many years after an initial diagnosis recently researchers discovered that abnormal white blood cells can be present in the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients a number of years before a diagnosis this finding may lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease and how the disease progresses in acute leukemia symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly people with this disease usually go to their doctor because they feel sick white blood cell levels may be high people with leukemia may have very high levels of white blood cells but because the cells are abnormal they are unable to fight infection therefore patients may develop frequent fevers or infections a shortage of red blood cells called anemia can cause a person to feel tired not having enough blood platelets may cause a person to bleed and bruise easily some symptoms depend on where leukemia cells collect in the body leukemia cells can collect in many different tissues and organs such as the digestive tract kidneys lungs lymph nodes or other parts of the body including the eyes brain and testicles other common symptoms other common symptoms of leukemia include headache weight loss pain in the bones or joints swelling or discomfort in the abdomen from an enlarged spleen and swollen lymph nodes especially in the neck or armpit symptoms of acute leukemia may include vomiting confusion loss of muscle control and seizures some of the symptoms of leukemia are similar to those caused by the flu or other common diseases so these symptoms are not sure signs of leukemia it is important to check with your doctor if you have these symptoms only a doctor can diagnose and treat leukemia diagnosing leukemia physical exam blood tests biopsy to find the cause of leukemia symptoms the doctor will ask about medical history and conduct a physical exam during the exam the doctor will check for signs of disease such as lumps swelling in the lymph nodes spleen and liver or anything else that seems unusual the doctor will need to do blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells the doctor also may look at certain factors in the blood to see if leukemia has affected other organs such as the liver or kidneys even if blood tests suggest leukemia the doctor may look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow by doing a biopsy before making a diagnosis a biopsy is a procedure where a small amount of bone marrow is removed from a bone a pathologist examines the sample under a microscope to look for abnormal cells there are two ways the doctor can obtain bone marrow in a bone marrow aspiration marrow is collected by inserting a needle into the hipbone or another large bone and removing a small amount of bone marrow a bone marrow biopsy is performed with a larger needle and removes bone marrow and a small piece of bone if leukemia cells are found if leukemia cells are found in the bone marrow sample the doctor may perform more tests to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body the doctor may collect a sample of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord by performing a spinal tap and checking for leukemia cells or other signs of problems computed tomography ct scans and ultrasounds are tests used to determine if leukemia has spread from the bone marrow these tests produce pictures of the inside of the body with these tests the doctor looks for abnormalities such as enlarged organs or signs of infection,"leukemia, chronic and acute leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, anemia, headache, pain, seizures, flu","biopsy, ct scans",,"Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Headache, Seizures, Flu, Pain, Anemia",Biopsy,

are mitochondrial genetic disorders inherited mitochondrial genetic disorder can be inherited in a variety of manners depending on the type of condition and the location of the disease causing change mutation those caused by mutations in mitochondrial dna are transmitted by maternal inheritance only egg cells not sperm cells contribute mitochondria to the next generation so only females can pass on mitochondrial mutations to their children conditions resulting from mutations in mitochondrial dna can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females in some cases the condition results from a new de novo mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in a person with no history of the condition in the family mitochondrial genetic disorders caused by mutations in nuclear dna may follow an autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or x linked pattern of inheritance in autosomal dominant conditions one mutated copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs or symptoms of the condition in some cases an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent other cases may result from new mutations in the gene these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family a person with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50 chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child when a condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner a person must have a change in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell the parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition when two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children each child has a 25 1 in 4 risk to have the condition a 50 1 in 2 risk to be a carrier like each of the parents and a 25 chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier a condition is considered x linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the x chromosome one of the two sex chromosomes the y chromosome is the other sex chromosome women have two x chromosomes and men have an x and a y chromosome x linked conditions can be x linked dominant or x linked recessive the inheritance is x linked dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition women with an x linked dominant condition have a 50 chance of passing the condition on to a son or a daughter with each pregnancy men with an x linked dominant condition will pass the condition on to all of their daughters and none of their sons the inheritance is x linked recessive if a gene on the x chromosome causes the condition in men with one gene mutation they have only one x chromosome and in females with two gene mutations they have two x chromosomes a woman with an x linked condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters this means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers a man with an x linked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters carriers and none of his sons,mitochondrial genetic disorders,,,"Genetic Disorders, Mitochondrial genetic disorders",,

mutations in the elane gene cause cyclic neutropenia the elane gene provides instructions for making a protein called neutrophil elastase which is found in neutrophils when the body starts an immune response to fight an infection neutrophils release neutrophil elastase this protein then modifies the function of certain cells and proteins to help fight the infection elane gene mutations that cause cyclic neutropenia lead to an abnormal neutrophil elastase protein that seems to retain some of its function however neutrophils that produce abnormal neutrophil elastase protein appear to have a shorter lifespan than normal neutrophils the shorter neutrophil lifespan is thought to be responsible for the cyclic nature of this condition when the affected neutrophils die early there is a period in which there is a shortage of neutrophils because it takes time for the body to replenish its supply,,,,,,

how might hereditary multiple osteochondromas hmo be treated currently there is no known medical treatment for hmo osteochondromas are not usually removed because they stop growing around age 12 another consideration is how close the tumor is to the affected bone s growth plate because surgery can affect how the bone grows surgery may be considered however if an osteochondroma is causing pain bone fracture nerve irritation or if the tumor continues to grow after the person s bones have stopped growing the surgical treatment of choice is complete removal of the tumor depending on the location of the osteochondroma this may be relatively simple however if an osteochondroma is close to nerves and blood vessels this may make surgery difficult and risky surgery may also be necessary to correct painful limb abnormalities that are caused by multiple osteochondromas surgery may be needed to cut and realign the bones that have become deformed which is known as osteotomy if the legs are not equal in length treatment may include a procedure to slow down the growth of the longer leg surgery may also be needed to correct the forearm deformity seen in this condition adults with this condition who have untreated forearm deformities usually do not have significant functional limitations although rare an osteochondroma can become cancerous malignant which usually takes the form of a low grade chondrosarcoma this type of malignant tumor is unlikely to spread elsewhere in the body higher grades of cancer can occur but this is even more uncommon in that case other therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation may be used in treatment genereviews provides more information about treatment for hereditary multiple osteochondromas how might a malignant transformation in hereditary multiple exostoses hme be treated chondrosarcomas in a person with hme tend to be well differentiated and low grade tumors the tumors usually grow slowly and do not readily metastasize surgical removal is the recommended treatment as the condrosarcomas do not respond to radiation or chemotherapy the prognosis or long term outlook after surgical removal of the chondrosarcoma for a person with hme is good as long as the tumor has not metastasized,"hereditary multiple osteochondromas, pain, chondrosarcoma, cancer",surgery,,"Cancer, Pain, Hereditary multiple osteochondromas, Chondrosarcoma",Surgery,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with adult hodgkin lymphoma patients with hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for hodgkin lymphoma three types of standard treatment are used chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery for pregnant patients with hodgkin lymphoma treatment options also include watchful waiting steroid therapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant monoclonal antibody therapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with adult hodgkin lymphoma different types of treatment are available for patients with adult hodgkin lymphoma some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment for pregnant women with hodgkin lymphoma treatment is carefully chosen to protect the fetus treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes the stage of the hodgkin lymphoma and the age of the fetus the treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms cancer and pregnancy change choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient family and health care team patients with hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers with expertise in treating lymphomas treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating cancer the medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and expertise in treating adult hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine these may include the following specialists neurosurgeon neurologist rehabilitation specialist radiation oncologist endocrinologist hematologist other oncology specialists patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for hodgkin lymphoma treatment with chemotherapy and or radiation therapy for hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of second cancers and other health problems for many months or years after treatment these late effects depend on the type of treatment and the patient s age when treated and may include acute myelogenous leukemia cancer of the breast bone cervix gastrointestinal tract head and neck lung soft tissue and thyroid heart lung and thyroid disease avascular necrosis of bone death of bone cells caused by lack of blood flow herpes zoster shingles or severe infection depression and fatigue infertility hypogonadism low levels of testosterone and estrogen regular follow up by doctors who are expert in finding and treating late effects is important for the long term health of patients treated for hodgkin lymphoma three types of standard treatment are used chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated combination chemotherapy is treatment with more than one anticancer drug when a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for hodgkin lymphoma it isn t possible to protect the fetus from being exposed to the chemotherapy some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester vinblastine is an anticancer drug that has not been linked with birth defects when given in the second half of pregnancy see drugs approved for hodgkin lymphoma for more information radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat adult hodgkin lymphoma for a pregnant woman with hodgkin lymphoma radiation therapy should be postponed until after delivery if possible to avoid any risk to the fetus if immediate treatment is needed the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy however lead used to shield the fetus may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future surgery laparotomy is a procedure in which an incision cut is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease the size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease if cancer is found the tissue or organ is removed during the laparotomy for pregnant patients with hodgkin lymphoma treatment options also include watchful waiting watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change delivery may be induced when the fetus is 32 to 36 weeks old so that the mother can begin treatment steroid therapy steroids are hormones made naturally in the body by the adrenal glands and by reproductive organs some types of steroids are made in a laboratory certain steroid drugs have been found to help chemotherapy work better and help stop the growth of cancer cells steroids can also help the lungs of the fetus develop faster than normal this is important when delivery is induced early see drugs approved for hodgkin lymphoma for more information new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant high dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after therapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the body s blood cells the use of lower dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is also being studied monoclonal antibody therapy monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options for adult hodgkin lymphoma early favorable hodgkin

key points after ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for ovarian germ cell tumors stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv after ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body the process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease unless a doctor is sure the cancer has spread from the ovaries to other parts of the body an operation called a laparotomy is done to see if the cancer has spread the doctor must cut into the abdomen and carefully look at all the organs to see if they have cancer in them the doctor will cut out small pieces of tissue so they can be checked under a microscope for signs of cancer the doctor may also wash the abdominal cavity with fluid which is also checked under a microscope to see if it has cancer cells in it usually the doctor will remove the cancer and other organs that have cancer in them during the laparotomy it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment many of the tests used to diagnose ovarian germ cell tumor are also used for staging the following tests and procedures may also be used for staging pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri transvaginal ultrasound exam a procedure used to examine the vagina uterus fallopian tubes and bladder an ultrasound transducer probe is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high energy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram the doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor for example if an ovarian germ cell tumor spreads to the liver the tumor cells in the liver are actually cancerous

found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen or in washings of the peritoneum tissue lining the peritoneal cavity stage ii in stage ii cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis stage ii is divided into stage iia stage iib and stage iic stage iia cancer has spread to the uterus and or fallopian tubes the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus stage iib cancer has spread to other tissue within the pelvis stage iic cancer is found inside one or both ovaries and has spread to the uterus and or fallopian tubes or to other tissue within the pelvis also one of the following is true cancer is found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or the capsule outer covering of the ovary has ruptured broken open or cancer cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen or in

nearby lymph nodes stage iii is divided into stage iiia stage iiib and stage iiic stage iiia the tumor is found in the pelvis only but cancer cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen the small intestines or the tissue that connects the small intestines to the wall of the abdomen stage iiib cancer has spread to the peritoneum and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller stage iiic cancer has spread to the peritoneum and the cancer in the peritoneum is larger than 2 centimeters and or cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen cancer that has spread to the surface of the liver is also considered stage iii ovarian cancer stage iv in stage iv

purpose of peritoneal dialysis the purpose of peritoneal dialysis is to filter wastes and extra fluid from your body this type of dialysis uses the lining of your bellythe space in your body that holds your stomach bowels and liverto filter your blood this lining called the peritoneum acts to do the work of your kidneys how peritoneal dialysis works a doctor will place a soft tube called a catheter in your belly a few weeks before you start treatment the catheter stays in your belly permanently when you start peritoneal dialysis you will empty a kind of salty water called dialysis solution from a plastic bag through the catheter into your belly when the bag is empty you can disconnect your catheter from the bag so you can move around and do your normal activities while the dialysis solution is inside your belly it soaks up wastes and extra fluid from your body after a few hours you drain the used dialysis solution through another tube into a drain bag you can throw away the used dialysis solution now filled with wastes and extra fluid in a toilet or tub then you start over with a fresh bag of dialysis solution the process of emptying the used dialysis solution and refilling your belly with fresh solution is called an exchange the process goes on continuously so you always have dialysis solution in your belly soaking up wastes and extra fluid from your body types of peritoneal dialysis two types of peritoneal dialysis are available after you have learned about the types of peritoneal dialysis you can choose the type that best fits your life if one schedule or type of peritoneal dialysis does not suit you talk with your doctor about trying the other type continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not require a machine and you can do it in any clean well lit place the time period that the dialysis solution is in your belly is the dwell time with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis the dialysis solution stays in your belly for a dwell time of 4 to 6 hours or more the process of draining the used dialysis solution and replacing it with fresh solution takes about 30 to 40 minutes most people change the dialysis solution at least four times a day and sleep with solution in their belly at night with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis you do not have to wake up and perform dialysis tasks during the night continuous cycler assisted peritoneal dialysis uses a machine called a cycler to fill and empty your belly three to five times during the night while you sleep in the morning you begin one exchange with a dwell time that lasts the entire day you may do an additional exchange in the middle of the afternoon without the cycler to increase the amount of waste removed and to reduce the amount of fluid left behind in your body you may need a combination of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cycler assisted peritoneal dialysis if you weigh more than 175 pounds or if your peritoneum filters wastes slowly for example some people use a cycler at night and perform one exchange during the day others do four exchanges during the day and use a minicycler to perform one or more exchanges during the night youll work with your health care team to find the best schedule for you pros and cons of peritoneal dialysis each type of peritoneal dialysis has pros and cons continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis pros you can do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis alone you can do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis at the times you choose as long as you perform the required number of exchanges each day you can do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in many locations you can travel as long as you bring dialysis bags with you or have them delivered to your destination you dont need a machine for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis you gain a sense of control over your treatment cons continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis can disrupt your daily schedule continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a continuous treatment and you should do all exchanges 7 days a week boxes of dialysis solution will take up space in your home continuous cycler assisted peritoneal dialysis pros you can do exchanges at night while you sleep you may not have to perform exchanges during the day cons you need a machine your connection to the cycler limits your movement at night questions to ask my doctor is peritoneal dialysis the best treatment choice for me why if yes which type is best what type of training do i need and how long will it take what does peritoneal dialysis feel like how will peritoneal dialysis affect my ____ blood pressure diabetes other conditions will i be able to keep working will i be able to care for my children how much should

primary sclerosing cholangitis is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors researchers believe that genetic changes play a role in this condition because it often occurs in several members of a family and because immediate family members of someone with primary sclerosing cholangitis have an increased risk of developing the condition it is likely that specific genetic variations increase a person s risk of developing primary sclerosing cholangitis and then exposure to certain environmental factors triggers the disorder however the genetic changes that increase susceptibility and the environmental triggers remain unclear there is evidence that variations in certain genes involved in immune function influence the risk of developing primary sclerosing cholangitis the most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen hla complex the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria each hla gene has many different normal variations allowing each person s immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins specific variations of several hla genes seem to be present more often in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis than in people who do not have the disorder these variations may dysregulate the body s immune response leading to the inflammation of the bile ducts in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis however the mechanism is not well understood researchers are also studying variations in other genes related to the body s immune function to understand how they contribute to the risk of developing this condition,,,,,,

key points wilms tumors are staged during surgery and with imaging tests there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body in addition to the stages wilms tumors are described by their histology the following stages are used for both favorable histology and anaplastic wilms tumors stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv stage v the treatment of other childhood kidney tumors depends on the tumor type wilms tumors are staged during surgery and with imaging tests the process used to find out if cancer has spread outside of the kidney to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the doctor will use results of the diagnostic and staging tests to help find out the stage of the disease the following tests may be done to see if cancer has spread to other places in the body lymph node biopsy a surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy or lymph node dissection liver function test a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver a higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the liver is not working as it should x ray of the chest and bones an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body such as the chest ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the abdomen pelvis chest and brain taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye is injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography pet ct scan a procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography pet scan and a computed tomography ct scan the pet and ct scans are done at the same time on the same machine the pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself a pet scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the abdomen pelvis and brain this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri bone scan a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner ultrasound exam a procedure in which high energy sound waves ultrasound are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram an ultrasound of the major heart vessels is done to stage wilms tumor cystoscopy a procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas a cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder a cystoscope is a thin tube like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing it may also have a tool to remove tissue samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if wilms tumor spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually wilms tumor cells the disease is metastatic wilms tumor not lung cancer in addition to the stages wilms tumors are described by their histology the histology how the cells look under a microscope of the tumor affects the prognosis and the treatment of wilms tumor the histology may be favorable or anaplastic unfavorable tumors with a favorable histology have a better prognosis and respond better to chemotherapy than anaplastic tumors tumor cells that are anaplastic divide quickly and under a microscope do not look like the type of cells they came from anaplastic tumors are harder to treat with chemotherapy than other wilms tumors at the same stage the following stages are used for both favorable histology and anaplastic wilms tumors stage i in stage i the tumor was completely removed by surgery and all of the following are true cancer was found only in the kidney and had not spread to blood vessels in the renal sinus the part of the kidney where it joins the ureter or to the lymph nodes the outer layer of the kidney did not break open the tumor did not break open a biopsy was not done before the tumor was removed no cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed stage ii in stage ii the tumor was completely removed by surgery and no cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed cancer has not spread to lymph nodes before the tumor was removed one of the following was true cancer had spread to the renal sinus the part of the kidney where it joins the ureter cancer had spread to blood vessels outside the area of the kidney where urine is made such as the renal sinus stage iii in stage iii cancer remains in the abdomen after surgery and one of the following may be true cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis the part of the body between the hips cancer has spread to or through the surface of the peritoneum the layer of tissue that lines the abdominal cavity and covers most organs in the abdomen a biopsy of the tumor was done before it was removed the tumor broke open before or during surgery to remove it the tumor was removed in more than one piece cancer cells are found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed the entire tumor could not be removed because important organs or tissues in the body would be damaged stage iv in stage iv cancer has spread through the blood to organs such as the lungs liver bone or brain or to lymph nodes outside of the abdomen and pelvis stage v in stage v cancer cells are found in both kidneys when the cancer is first diagnosed the treatment of other childhood kidney tumors depends on the tumor

nodes tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to detect find and diagnose childhood non hodgkin lymphoma a biopsy is done to diagnose childhood non hodgkin lymphoma certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options childhood non hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system childhood non hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system which is part of the body s immune system the immune system protects the body from foreign substances infection and diseases the lymph system is made up of the following lymph colorless watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors there are three types of lymphocytes b lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection t lymphocytes that help b lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses lymph vessels a network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream lymph nodes small bean shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck underarm abdomen pelvis and groin spleen an organ that makes lymphocytes filters the blood stores blood cells and destroys old blood cells the spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach thymus an organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply the thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone tonsils two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat the tonsils make lymphocytes bone marrow the soft spongy tissue in the center of large bones bone marrow makes white blood cells red blood cells and platelets non hodgkin lymphoma can begin in b lymphocytes t lymphocytes or natural killer cells lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and collect in the lymph nodes spleen and thymus lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach thyroid gland brain and skin non hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children treatment for children is different than treatment for adults see the following pdq summaries for information about treatment of non hodgkin lymphoma in adults adult non hodgkin lymphoma primary cns lymphoma treatment mycosis fungoides and the sezary syndrome treatment the main types of lymphoma

lymphoma see the pdq summary on childhood hodgkin lymphoma treatment for information about childhood hodgkin lymphoma there are three major types of childhood non hodgkin lymphoma the type of lymphoma is determined by how the cells look under a microscope the three major types of childhood non hodgkin lymphoma are mature b cell non hodgkin lymphoma mature b cell non hodgkin lymphomas include burkitt and burkitt like lymphoma leukemia burkitt lymphoma and burkitt leukemia are different forms of the same disease burkitt lymphoma leukemia is an aggressive fast growing disorder of b lymphocytes that is most common in children and young adults it may form in the abdomen waldeyer s ring testicles bone bone marrow skin or central nervous system cns burkitt leukemia may start in the lymph nodes as burkitt lymphoma and then spread to the blood and bone marrow or it may start in the blood and bone marrow without forming in the lymph nodes first both burkitt leukemia and burkitt lymphoma have been linked to infection with the epstein barr virus ebv although ebv infection is more likely to occur in patients in africa than in the united states burkitt and burkitt like lymphoma leukemia are diagnosed when a sample of tissue is checked and a certain change to the c myc gene is found diffuse large b cell lymphoma diffuse large b cell lymphoma is the most common type of non hodgkin lymphoma it is a type of b cell non hodgkin lymphoma that grows quickly in the lymph nodes the spleen liver bone marrow or other organs are also often affected diffuse large b cell lymphoma occurs more often in adolescents than in children primary mediastinal b cell lymphoma a type of lymphoma that develops from b cells in the mediastinum the area behind the breastbone it may spread to nearby organs including the lungs and the sac around the heart it may also spread to lymph nodes and distant organs including the kidneys in children and adolescents primary mediastinal b cell lymphoma occurs more often in older adolescents lymphoblastic lymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects t cell lymphocytes it usually forms in the mediastinum the area behind the breastbone this causes trouble breathing wheezing trouble swallowing or swelling of the head and neck it may spread to lymph nodes bone bone marrow skin the cns abdominal organs and other areas lymphoblastic lymphoma is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia all anaplastic large cell lymphoma anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects t cell lymphocytes it usually forms in the lymph nodes skin or bone and sometimes forms in the gastrointestinal tract lung tissue that covers the lungs and muscle patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma have a receptor called cd30 on the surface of their t cells in many children anaplastic large cell lymphoma is marked by changes in the alk gene that makes a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase a pathologist checks for these cell and gene changes to help diagnose anaplastic large cell lymphoma some types of non hodgkin lymphoma are rare in children some types of childhood non hodgkin lymphoma are less common these include pediatric type follicular lymphoma in children follicular lymphoma occurs mainly in males it is more likely to be found in one area and does not spread to other places in the body it usually forms in the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck but may also form in the testicles kidney gastrointestinal tract and salivary gland marginal zone lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that tends to grow and spread slowly and is usually found at an early stage it may be found in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes marginal zone lymphoma found outside the lymph nodes in children is called mucosa associated lymphoid tissue malt lymphoma and may be linked to helicobacter pylori infection of the gastrointestinal tract and chlamydophila psittaci infection of the conjunctival membrane which lines the eye primary central nervous system cns lymphoma primary cns lymphoma is extremely rare in children peripheral t cell lymphoma peripheral t cell lymphoma is an aggressive fast growing non hodgkin lymphoma that begins in mature t lymphocytes the t lymphocytes mature in the thymus gland and travel to other parts of the lymph system such as the lymph nodes bone marrow and spleen cutaneous t cell lymphoma cutaneous t cell lymphoma begins in the skin and can cause the skin to thicken or form a tumor it is very rare in children but is more common in adolescents and young adults there are different types of cutaneous t cell lymphoma such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma subcutaneous panniculitis like t cell lymphoma gamma

fascioliasis occurs in many areas of the world and usually is caused by f hepatica which is a common liver fluke of sheep and cattle in general fascioliasis is more common and widespread in animals than in people even so the number of infected people in the world is thought to exceed 2 million fasciola hepatica is found in more than 50 countries in all continents except antarctica it is found in parts of latin america the caribbean europe the middle east africa asia and oceania fasciola gigantica is less widespread human cases have been reported in the tropics in parts of africa and asia and also in hawaii in some areas where fascioliasis is found human cases are uncommon sporadic in other areas human fascioliasis is very common hyperendemic for example the areas with the highest known rates of human infection are in the andean highlands of bolivia and peru special conditions are needed for fascioliasis to be present in an area and its geographic distribution is very patchy focal the eggs passed in the stool of infected mammals have to develop mature in a suitable aquatic snail host to be able to infect another mammalian host requirements include sufficient moisture and favorable temperatures above 50 f that allow the development of miracidia reproduction of snails and larval development within the snails these factors also contribute to both the prevalence and level intensity of infection prevalence is highest in areas where climatic conditions promote development of cercariae more on biology infective fasciola larvae metacercariae are found in contaminated water either stuck to encysted on water plants or floating in the water often in marshy areas ponds or flooded pastures people and animals typically become infected by eating raw watercress or other contaminated water plants the plants may be eaten as a snack or in salads or sandwiches people also can get infected by ingesting contaminated water such as by drinking it or by eating vegetables that were washed or irrigated with contaminated water infection also can result from eating undercooked sheep or goat livers that contain immature forms of the parasite the possibility of becoming infected in the united states should be considered despite the fact that few locally acquired cases have been documented the prerequisites for the fasciola life cycle exist in some parts of the united states in addition transmission because of imported contaminated produce could occur as has been documented in europe,oceania,,,,,
how is alpha thalassemia inherited the inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complex because the condition involves two genes hba1 and hba2 people have two copies of the hba1 gene and two copies of the hba2 gene in each cell each copy is called an allele therefore there are 4 alleles that produce alpha globin the protein that results from these genes for each of the 2 genes one allele is inherited from a person s father and the other is inherited from a person s mother so each person inherits 2 alleles from each parent the different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles if both parents are missing at least one alpha globin allele each of their children are at risk of having hb bart syndrome or hydrops fetalis hemoglobin h hbh disease or alpha thalassemia trait the precise risk depends on how many alleles are missing and which combination of the hba1 and hba2 genes is affected in most cases a person with 1 mutated allele is a carrier and has no signs or symptoms a person with 2 mutated alleles may have mild signs or symptoms of alpha thalassemia called alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia trait a person with 3 mutated alleles has moderate to severe symptoms called hbh disease when there are 4 mutated alleles the condition is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis in these cases an affected fetus usually does not survive to birth or an affected newborn does not survive long after birth,"thalassemia, hydrops fetalis",,,"Thalassemia, Hydrops fetalis, Alpha-thalassemia",,

key points after gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body there is no staging system for hydatidiform moles the following stages are used for gtn stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv the treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease stage or risk group after gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body the process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called staging the information gathered from the staging process helps determine the stage of disease for gtn stage is one of the factors used to plan treatment the following tests and procedures may be done to help find out the stage of the disease chest x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the chest an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film making pictures of areas inside the body ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography mri magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as brain and spinal cord a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri lumbar puncture a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid csf from the spinal column this is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the csf around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid the sample of csf is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord this procedure is also called an lp or spinal tap there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if choriocarcinoma spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually choriocarcinoma cells the disease is metastatic choriocarcinoma not lung cancer there is no staging system for hydatidiform moles hydatidiform moles hm are found in the uterus only and do not spread to other parts of the body the following stages are used for gtn stage i in stage i the tumor is in the uterus only stage ii in stage ii cancer has spread outside of the uterus to the ovary fallopian tube vagina and or the ligaments that support the uterus stage iii in stage iii cancer has spread to the lung stage iv in stage iv cancer has spread to distant parts of the body other than the lungs the treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is based on the type of disease stage or risk group invasive moles and choriocarcinomas are treated based on risk groups the stage of the invasive mole or choriocarcinoma is one factor used to determine risk group other factors include the following the age of the patient when the diagnosis is made whether the gtn occurred after a molar pregnancy miscarriage or normal pregnancy how soon the tumor was diagnosed after the pregnancy began the level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin hcg in the blood the size of the largest tumor where the tumor has spread to and the number of tumors in the body how many chemotherapy drugs the tumor has been treated with for recurrent or resistant tumors there are two risk groups for invasive moles and choriocarcinomas low risk and high risk patients with low risk disease usually receive less aggressive treatment than patients with high risk disease placental site trophoblastic tumor pstt and

about 70 percent of all cases of hypochondroplasia are caused by mutations in the fgfr3 gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue although it remains unclear how fgfr3 mutations lead to the features of hypochondroplasia researchers believe that these genetic changes cause the protein to be overly active the overactive fgfr3 protein likely interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth that are characteristic of this disorder in the absence of a mutation in the fgfr3 gene the cause of hypochondroplasia is unknown researchers suspect that mutations in other genes are involved although these genes have not been identified,hypochondroplasia,,,Hypochondroplasia,,

many cases of botulism are preventable foodborne botulism has often been from home canned foods with low acid content such as asparagus green beans beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods however seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture at retail or by consumers some examples are chopped garlic in oil canned cheese sauce chile peppers tomatoes carrot juice and baked potatoes wrapped in foil in alaska foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the us department of agriculture oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures persons who eat home canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust the bacteria can be found inside homes on floors carpet and countertops even after cleaning honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older,botulism,,,Botulism,,

the genetic causes of beckwith wiedemann syndrome are complex the condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11 people normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent for most genes on chromosome 11 both copies of the gene are expressed or turned on in cells for some genes however only the copy inherited from a person s father the paternally inherited copy is expressed for other genes only the copy inherited from a person s mother the maternally inherited copy is expressed these parent specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of beckwith wiedemann syndrome at least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of dna in genes that undergo genomic imprinting methylation is one way that a gene s parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells beckwith wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of dna on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers ics ics control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth including the cdkn1c h19 igf2 and kcnq1ot1 genes abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of beckwith wiedemann syndrome about twenty percent of cases of beckwith wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy upd paternal upd causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother people with paternal upd are also missing genes that are active only on the maternally inherited copy of the chromosome in beckwith wiedemann syndrome paternal upd usually occurs early in embryonic development and affects only some of the body s cells this phenomenon is called mosaicism mosaic paternal upd leads to an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 11 which underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder less commonly mutations in the cdkn1c gene cause beckwith wiedemann syndrome this gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control growth before birth mutations in the cdkn1c gene prevent this protein from restraining growth which leads to the abnormalities characteristic of beckwith wiedemann syndrome about 1 percent of all people with beckwith wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement translocation abnormal copying duplication or loss deletion of genetic material from chromosome 11 like the other genetic changes responsible for beckwith wiedemann syndrome these abnormalities disrupt the normal regulation of certain genes on this chromosome,,,,,,

what happens during screening checking for cancer in a person who does not have any symptoms is called screening screening can help diagnose skin problems before they have a chance to become cancerous a doctor usually a dermatologist screens for skin cancer by performing a total body skin examination during a skin exam the dermatologist or other health care professional looks for changes in the skin that could be skin cancer and checks moles birth marks or pigmentation for the abcd signs of melanoma he or she is looking for abnormal size color shape or texture of moles and irregular patches of skin screening examinations are very likely to detect large numbers of benign skin conditions which are very common in older people even experienced doctors have difficulty distinguishing between benign skin irregularities and early carcinomas or melanomas to reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis you might want to get a second opinion from another health professional self examinations you can also perform self examinations to check for early signs of melanoma make sure to have someone else check your back and other hard to see areas do not attempt to shave off or cauterize destroy with heat any suspicious areas of skin risk tool the national cancer institute developed a melanoma risk tool which can help patients and their doctors determine their risk the tool can be found at http www cancer gov melanomarisktool performing a biopsy in order to diagnose whether or not there is skin cancer a mole or small piece of abnormal skin is usually removed then a doctor will study the suspicious cells under a microscope or perform other tests on the skin sample this procedure is called a biopsy it is the only sure way to diagnose skin cancer you may have the biopsy in a doctor s office or as an outpatient in a clinic or hospital where it is done depends on the size and place of the abnormal area on your skin you may have local anesthesia which means that you can be awake for the procedure if cancer is found if the biopsy shows you have cancer tests might be done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body often the cancer cells spread to nearby tissues and then to the lymph nodes has the cancer spread lymph nodes are an important part of the body s immune system lymph nodes are masses of lymphatic tissue surrounded by connective tissue lymph nodes play a role in immune defense by filtering lymphatic fluid and storing white blood cells often in the case of melanomas a surgeon performs a lymph node test by injecting either a radioactive substance or a blue dye or both near the skin tumor next the surgeon uses a scanner to find the lymph nodes containing the radioactive substance or stained with the dye the surgeon might then remove the nodes to check for the presence of cancer cells if the doctor suspects that the tumor may have spread the doctor might also use computed axial tomography cat scan or ct scan or magnetic resonance imaging mri to try to locate tumors in other parts of the body,"cancer, skin cancer, moles, melanoma","biopsy, anesthesia",,"Skin Cancer, Melanoma, Skin Conditions, Moles, Cancer","Biopsy, Anesthesia",
systemic scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and internal organs autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body s own tissues and organs the word scleroderma means hard skin in greek and the condition is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue fibrosis in the skin and other organs the condition is also called systemic sclerosis because the fibrosis can affect organs other than the skin fibrosis is due to the excess production of a tough protein called collagen which normally strengthens and supports connective tissues throughout the body the signs and symptoms of systemic scleroderma usually begin with episodes of raynaud phenomenon which can occur weeks to years before fibrosis in raynaud phenomenon the fingers and toes of affected individuals turn white or blue in response to cold temperature or other stresses this effect occurs because of problems with the small vessels that carry blood to the extremities another early sign of systemic scleroderma is puffy or swollen hands before thickening and hardening of the skin due to fibrosis skin thickening usually occurs first in the fingers called sclerodactyly and may also involve the hands and face in addition people with systemic scleroderma often have open sores ulcers on their fingers painful bumps under the skin calcinosis or small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin telangiectasia fibrosis can also affect internal organs and can lead to impairment or failure of the affected organs the most commonly affected organs are the esophagus heart lungs and kidneys internal organ involvement may be signaled by heartburn difficulty swallowing dysphagia high blood pressure hypertension kidney problems shortness of breath diarrhea or impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract intestinal pseudo obstruction there are three types of systemic scleroderma defined by the tissues affected in the disorder in one type of systemic scleroderma known as limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma fibrosis usually affects only the hands arms and face limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma used to be known as crest syndrome which is named for the common features of the condition calcinosis raynaud phenomenon esophageal motility dysfunction sclerodactyly and telangiectasia in another type of systemic scleroderma known as diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma the fibrosis affects large areas of skin including the torso and the upper arms and legs and often involves internal organs in diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma the condition worsens quickly and organ damage occurs earlier than in other types of the condition in the third type of systemic scleroderma called systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma sine means without in latin fibrosis affects one or more internal organs but not the skin approximately 15 percent to 25 percent of people with features of systemic scleroderma also have signs and symptoms of another condition that affects connective tissue such as polymyositis dermatomyositis rheumatoid arthritis sjgren syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus the combination of systemic scleroderma with other connective tissue abnormalities is known as scleroderma overlap syndrome,"systemic scleroderma, scleroderma, heartburn, high blood pressure, diarrhea, crest syndrome, diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus",,,"High Blood Pressure, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Arthritis, Diarrhea, Scleroderma, Lupus, Heartburn, Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, Dermatomyositis, Polymyositis, CREST syndrome, Systemic scleroderma",,

key points after rectal cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for rectal cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv after rectal cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body the process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process chest x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the chest an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body colonoscopy a procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps small pieces of bulging tissue abnormal areas or cancer a colonoscope is a thin tube like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing it may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the abdomen pelvis or chest taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do endorectal ultrasound a procedure used to examine the rectum and nearby organs an ultrasound transducer probe is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high energy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram the doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram this procedure is also called transrectal ultrasound there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if rectal cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually rectal cancer cells the disease is metastatic rectal cancer not lung cancer the following stages are used for rectal cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ in stage 0 abnormal cells are found in the mucosa innermost layer of the rectum wall these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ stage i in stage i cancer has formed in the mucosa innermost layer of the rectum wall and has spread to the submucosa layer of tissue under the mucosa cancer may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall stage ii stage ii rectal cancer is divided into stage iia stage iib and stage iic stage iia cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall stage iib cancer has spread through the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall but has not spread to nearby organs stage iic cancer has spread through the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall to nearby organs stage iii stage iii rectal cancer is divided into stage iiia stage iiib and stage iiic in stage iiia cancer has spread through the mucosa innermost layer of the rectum wall to the submucosa layer of tissue under the mucosa and may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes or cancer has spread through the mucosa innermost layer of the rectum wall to the submucosa layer of tissue under the mucosa cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes in stage iiib cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes or cancer has spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall or to the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes or cancer has spread through the mucosa innermost layer of the rectum wall to the submucosa layer of tissue under the mucosa and may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes in stage iiic cancer has spread through the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall but has not spread to nearby organs cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes or cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall or has spread through the serosa but has not spread to nearby organs cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes or cancer has spread through the serosa outermost layer of the rectum wall and has spread to nearby organs cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes stage iv stage iv rectal cancer is divided into stage iva and stage ivb stage iva cancer may have spread through the rectum wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes cancer has spread to one organ that is not near the rectum such as the liver lung or ovary or to a distant lymph node stage ivb cancer may have spread through the rectum wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes cancer has spread to more than one organ that is not near the rectum or into the lining of the abdominal wall,"rectal cancer, cancer, lung cancer","colonoscopy,

therapy there are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials biologic therapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment five types of standard treatment are used surgery one of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor whipple procedure a surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas the gallbladder part of the stomach part of the small intestine and the bile duct are removed enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin total pancreatectomy this operation removes the whole pancreas part of the stomach part of the small intestine the common bile duct the gallbladder the spleen and nearby lymph nodes distal pancreatectomy the body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed if the cancer has spread and cannot be removed the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life surgical biliary bypass if cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder a biliary bypass may be done during this operation the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area endoscopic stent placement if the tumor is blocking the bile duct surgery may be done to put in a stent a thin tube to drain bile that has built up in the area the doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine gastric bypass if the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for pancreatic cancer for more information chemoradiation therapy chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow erlotinib is a type of tki used to treat pancreatic cancer see drugs approved for pancreatic cancer for more information there are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas when pain medicine is not enough there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain the doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor see the pdq summary on cancer pain for more information patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food as a result patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body to prevent malnutrition the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes see the pdq summary on nutrition in cancer care for more information new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options by stage stages i and ii pancreatic cancer treatment of stage i and stage ii

special camera linked to a computer to make a 3 dimensional 3 d picture of the brain a very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose as the substance travels through the blood the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing these areas will show up brighter in the picture this procedure may be done just before or after a ct scan spect is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do pet is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body a biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor if imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor a biopsy is usually done one of the following types of biopsies may be used stereotactic biopsy when imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done this kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3 dimensional 3 d scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue a small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull a biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer open biopsy when imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery an open biopsy may be done a part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy a sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist if cancer cells are found some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function there are also ways to test brain function during surgery the doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain the pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor the grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread the following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed immunohistochemistry a test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue the antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope this type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer light and electron microscopy a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells cytogenetic analysis a laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done for some tumors a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of

other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes genetic mutations affecting beta cells insulin and insulin action some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations or changes in a single gene these mutations are usually inherited but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin the most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus ndm and mody ndm occurs in the first 6 months of life mody is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life more information about ndm and mody is provided in the niddk health topic monogenic forms of diabetes other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors other genetic diseases diabetes occurs in people with down syndrome klinefelter syndrome and turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes the genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus which blocks the pancreas the risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron if the disorder is not treated iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs damage to or removal of the pancreas pancreatitis cancer and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production thus causing diabetes if the damaged pancreas is removed diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells endocrine diseases endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone glucagonoma a rare tumor of the pancreas can also cause diabetes the tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon hyperthyroidism a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone can also cause elevated blood glucose levels autoimmune disorders rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes this kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells similar to type 1 diabetes medications and chemical toxins some medications such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics anti seizure drugs psychiatric drugs and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action pentamidine a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia can increase the risk of pancreatitis beta cell damage and diabetes also glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis asthma lupus and ulcerative colitis many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans for example dioxina contaminant of the herbicide agent orange used during the vietnam warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes in 2000 based on a report from the institute of medicine the u s department of veterans affairs va added diabetes to the list of conditions for which vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation also a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes lipodystrophy lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body the condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes,"diabetes, down syndrome, klinefelter syndrome, turner syndrome, genetic disorders, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, pancreatitis, cancer, endocrine diseases, acromegaly, prediabetes, stress, hyperthyroidism, lupus, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, ulcerative colitis",,,"Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ulcerative Colitis, Pneumonia, Genetic Disorders, Arthritis, Endocrine Diseases, Asthma, Turner Syndrome, Prediabetes, Hemochromatosis, Down Syndrome, Cancer, Stress, Cystic Fibrosis, Lupus, Hyperthyroidism, Pancreatitis, Acromegaly, Klinefelter syndrome",,

dietary changes that may improve fecal incontinence include eating the right amount of fiber fiber can help with diarrhea and constipation fiber is found in fruits vegetables whole grains and beans fiber supplements sold in a pharmacy or in a health food store are another common source of fiber to treat fecal incontinence the academy of nutrition and dietetics recommends consuming 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day for adults and age plus five grams for children a 7 year old child for example should get 7 plus five or 12 grams of fiber a day american adults consume only 15 grams a day on average 2 fiber should be added to the diet slowly to avoid bloating getting plenty to drink drinking eight 8 ounce glasses of liquid a day may help prevent constipation water is a good choice drinks with caffeine alcohol milk or carbonation should be avoided if they trigger diarrhea keeping a food diary a food diary can help identify foods that cause diarrhea and increase the risk of fecal incontinence a food diary should list foods eaten portion size and when fecal incontinence occurs after a few days the diary may show a link between certain foods and fecal incontinence eating less of foods linked to fecal incontinence may improve symptoms a food diary can also be helpful to a health care provider treating a person with fecal incontinence common foods and drinks linked to fecal incontinence include dairy products such as milk cheese and ice cream drinks and foods containing caffeine cured or smoked meat such as sausage ham and turkey spicy foods alcoholic beverages fruits such as apples peaches and pears fatty and greasy foods sweeteners in diet drinks and sugarless gum and candy including sorbitol xylitol mannitol and fructose examples of foods that have fiber beans

care providers sometimes recommend using bulk laxatives such as citrucel and metamucil to develop more solid stools that are easier to control antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate may be recommended to slow down the bowels and help control the problem bowel training developing a regular bowel movement pattern can improve fecal incontinence especially fecal incontinence due to constipation bowel training involves trying to have bowel movements at specific times of the day such as after every meal over time the body becomes used to a regular bowel movement pattern thus reducing constipation and related fecal incontinence persistence is key to successful bowel training achieving a regular bowel control pattern can take weeks to months pelvic floor exercises and biofeedback exercises that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles may improve bowel control pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing and relaxing pelvic floor muscles 50 to 100 times a day a health care provider can help with proper technique biofeedback therapy may also help a person perform the exercises properly this therapy also improves a persons awareness of sensations in the rectum teaching how to coordinate squeezing of the external sphincter muscle with the sensation of rectal filling biofeedback training uses special sensors to measure bodily functions sensors include pressure or emg sensors in the anus pressure sensors in the rectum and a balloon in the rectum to produce graded sensations of rectal fullness the measurements are displayed on a video screen as sounds or line graphs the health care provider uses the information to help the person modify or change abnormal function the person practices the exercises at home success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of fecal incontinence its severity and the persons motivation and ability to follow the health care providers recommendations surgery surgery may be an option for fecal incontinence that fails to improve with other treatments or for fecal incontinence caused by pelvic floor or anal sphincter muscle injuries sphincteroplasty the most common fecal incontinence surgery reconnects the separated ends of a sphincter muscle torn by childbirth or another injury sphincteroplasty is performed at a hospital by a colorectal gynecological or general surgeon artificial anal sphincter involves placing an inflatable cuff around the anus and implanting a small pump beneath the skin that the person activates to inflate or deflate the cuff this surgery is much less common and is performed at a hospital by a specially trained colorectal surgeon nonabsorbable bulking agents can be injected into the wall of the anus to bulk up the tissue around the anus the bulkier tissues make the opening of the anus narrower so the sphincters are able to close better the procedure is performed in a health care providers office anesthesia is not needed the person can return to normal physical activities 1 week after the procedure bowel diversion is an operation that reroutes the normal movement of stool out of the body when part of the bowel is removed the operation diverts the lower part of the small intestine or colon to an opening in the wall of the abdomenthe area between the chest and hips an external pouch is attached to the opening to collect stool the procedure is performed by a surgeon in a hospital and anesthesia is used more information about these procedures can be found in the bowel diversion fact sheet electrical stimulation electrical stimulation also called sacral nerve stimulation or neuromodulation involves placing electrodes in the sacral nerves to the anus and rectum and continuously stimulating the nerves with electrical pulses the sacral nerves connect to the part of the spine in the hip area a battery operated stimulator is placed beneath the skin based on the persons response the health care provider can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that person the person can turn the stimulator on or off at any time the procedure is performed in an outpatient center using local anesthesia,"diarrhea, constipation,

october 2010 all visa and vrsa isolates have been susceptible to other food and drug administration fda approved drugs persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease tubes going into their bodies such as catheters previous infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents what is staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30 of individuals most of the time staph does not cause any harm these infections can look like pimples boils or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal including bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators endocarditis infection of the heart valves which can lead to heart failure osteomyelitis bone infection which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma puncture wound of foot or intravenous iv drug abuse top of page how do visa and vrsa get their names staph bacteria are classified as visa or vrsa based on laboratory tests laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections for vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube the result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration mic or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube therefore staph bacteria are classified as visa if the mic for vancomycin is 4 8µg ml and classified as vrsa if the vancomycin mic is 16µg ml top of page what should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph mrsa visa or

workplace risk factors lower exposure to radon it is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer diet physical activity the following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers vitamin e supplements cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer new ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers risk factors include smoking being overweight and not getting enough exercise increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer the following are risk factors for lung cancer cigarette cigar and pipe smoking tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer cigarette cigar and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked people who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke secondhand smoke being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product or that is exhaled by smokers people who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer causing agents as smokers although in smaller amounts inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking family history having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer people with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke hiv infection being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer people infected with hiv may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected since smoking rates are higher in those infected with hiv than in those not infected it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from hiv infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke environmental risk factors radiation exposure being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer atomic bomb radiation radiation therapy imaging tests and radon are sources of radiation exposure atomic bomb radiation being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer radiation therapy radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers including breast cancer and hodgkin lymphoma radiation therapy uses x rays gamma rays or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer the higher the dose of radiation received the higher the risk the risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers imaging tests imaging tests such as ct scans expose patients to radiation low dose spiral ct scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose ct scans in lung cancer screening the use of low dose spiral ct scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation radon radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil it seeps up through the ground and leaks into the air or water supply radon can enter homes through cracks in floors walls or the foundation and levels of radon can build up over time studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer the risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it in people who have never smoked about 30 of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon workplace exposure studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer asbestos arsenic chromium nickel beryllium cadmium tar and soot these substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked as the level of exposure to these substances increases the risk of lung cancer also increases the risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke air pollution studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers taking beta carotene supplements pills increases the risk of lung cancer especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day the risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day the following are protective factors for lung cancer not smoking the best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke quitting smoking smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting in smokers who have been treated for lung cancer quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers counseling the use of nicotine replacement products and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good in a person who has quit smoking the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting after a person has quit smoking for 10 years the risk of lung cancer decreases 30 to 50 see the following for more information on quitting smoking tobacco includes help with quitting cigarette smoking health risks and how to quit lower exposure to workplace risk factors laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer causing substances such as asbestos arsenic nickel and chromium may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke lower exposure to radon lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer especially among cigarette smokers high levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage such as sealing basements it is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer diet some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts however since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking physical activity some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not however since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer the following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer vitamin e supplements studies show that taking vitamin e supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer these may include eating fruits and vegetables exercising quitting smoking or taking certain medicines vitamins minerals or food supplements new ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country information about clinical trials can be

graves disease is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid which is a butterfly shaped gland in the lower neck the thyroid makes hormones that help regulate a wide variety of critical body functions for example thyroid hormones influence growth and development body temperature heart rate menstrual cycles and weight in people with graves disease the thyroid is overactive and makes more hormones than the body needs the condition usually appears in mid adulthood although it may occur at any age excess thyroid hormones can cause a variety of signs and symptoms these include nervousness or anxiety extreme tiredness fatigue a rapid and irregular heartbeat hand tremors frequent bowel movements or diarrhea increased sweating and difficulty tolerating hot conditions trouble sleeping and weight loss in spite of an increased appetite affected women may have menstrual irregularities such as an unusually light menstrual flow and infrequent periods some people with graves disease develop an enlargement of the thyroid called a goiter depending on its size the enlarged thyroid can cause the neck to look swollen and may interfere with breathing and swallowing between 25 and 50 percent of people with graves disease have eye abnormalities which are known as graves ophthalmopathy these eye problems can include swelling and inflammation redness dryness puffy eyelids and a gritty sensation like having sand or dirt in the eyes some people develop bulging of the eyes caused by inflammation of tissues behind the eyeball and pulling back retraction of the eyelids rarely affected individuals have more serious eye problems such as pain double vision and pinching compression of the optic nerve connecting the eye and the brain which can cause vision loss a small percentage of people with graves disease develop a skin abnormality called pretibial myxedema or graves dermopathy this abnormality causes the skin on the front of the lower legs and the tops of the feet to become thick lumpy and red it is not usually painful,"anxiety, fatigue, diarrhea, pain",,,"Fatigue, Diarrhea, Anxiety, Pain",,
the exact cause of asthma isn t known researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma most often early in life these factors include an inherited tendency to develop allergies called atopy at o pe parents who have asthma certain respiratory infections during childhood contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing if asthma or atopy runs in your family exposure to irritants for example tobacco smoke may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air some factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others researchers continue to explore what causes asthma the hygiene hypothesis one theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the hygiene hypothesis they believe that our western lifestylewith its emphasis on hygiene and sanitationhas resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past this affects the way that young children s immune systems develop during very early childhood and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma this is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions,"asthma, viral infections",,,"Asthma, Viral Infections",,
treatment for anemia depends on the type cause and severity of the condition treatments may include dietary changes or supplements medicines procedures or surgery to treat blood loss goals of treatment the goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry this is done by raising the red blood cell count and or hemoglobin level hemoglobin is the iron rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia dietary changes and supplements low levels of vitamins or iron in the body can cause some types of anemia these low levels might be the result of a poor diet or certain diseases or conditions to raise your vitamin or iron level your doctor may ask you to change your diet or take vitamin or iron supplements common vitamin supplements are vitamin b12 and folic acid folate vitamin c sometimes is given to help the body absorb iron iron your body needs iron to make hemoglobin your body can more easily absorb iron from meats than from vegetables or other foods to treat your anemia your doctor may suggest eating more meatespecially red meat such as beef or liver as well as chicken turkey pork fish and shellfish nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables tofu peas lentils white red and baked beans soybeans and chickpeas dried fruits such as prunes raisins and apricots prune juice iron fortified cereals and breads you can look at the nutrition facts label on packaged foods to find out how much iron the items contain the amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day iron also is available as a supplement it s usually combined with multivitamins and other minerals that help your body absorb iron doctors may recommend iron supplements for premature infants infants and young children who drink a lot of cow s milk and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn t fortified with iron large amounts of iron can be harmful so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes vitamin b12 low levels of vitamin b12 can lead to pernicious anemia this type of anemia often is treated with vitamin b12 supplements good food sources of vitamin b12 include breakfast cereals with added vitamin b12 meats such as beef liver poultry and fish eggs and dairy products such as milk yogurt and cheese foods fortified with vitamin b12 such as soy based beverages and vegetarian burgers folic acid folic acid folate is a form of vitamin b that s found in foods your body needs folic acid to make and maintain new cells folic acid also is very important for pregnant women it helps them avoid anemia and promotes healthy growth of the fetus good sources of folic acid include bread pasta and rice with added folic acid spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables black eyed peas and dried beans beef liver eggs bananas oranges orange juice and some other fruits and juices vitamin c vitamin c helps the body absorb iron good sources of vitamin c are vegetables and fruits especially citrus fruits citrus fruits include oranges grapefruits tangerines and similar fruits fresh and frozen fruits vegetables and juices usually have more vitaminc than canned ones if you re taking medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice this fruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work other fruits rich in vitamin c include kiwi fruit strawberries and cantaloupes vegetables rich in vitamin c include broccoli peppers brussels sprouts tomatoes cabbage potatoes and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach medicines your doctor may prescribe medicines to help your body make more red blood cells or to treat an underlying cause of anemia some of these medicines include antibiotics to treat infections hormones to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in teenaged and adult women a man made version of erythropoietin to stimulate your body to make more red blood cells this hormone has some risks you and your doctor will decide whether the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks medicines to prevent the body s immune system from destroying its own red blood cells chelation ke lay shun therapy for lead poisoning chelation therapy is used mainly in children this is because children who have iron deficiency anemia are at increased risk of lead poisoning procedures if your anemia is severe your doctor may recommend a medical procedure procedures include blood transfusions and blood and marrow stem cell transplants blood transfusion a blood transfusion is a safe common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous iv line in one of your blood vessels transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient s blood for more information go to the health topics blood transfusion article blood and marrow stem cell transplant a blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces your faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person a donor stem cells are made in the bone marrow they develop into red and white blood cells and platelets during the transplant which is like a blood transfusion you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest once the stem cells are in your body they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells for more information go to the health topics blood and marrow stem cell transplant article surgery if you have serious or life threatening bleeding that s causing anemia you may need surgery for example you may need surgery to control ongoing bleeding due to a stomach ulcer or colon cancer if your body is destroying red blood cells at a high rate you may need to have your spleen removed the spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body an enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal

mutations in the fmr1 gene increase the risk of developing fxtas the fmr1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fmrp which helps regulate the production of other proteins fmrp plays a role in the development of synapses which are specialized connections between nerve cells synapses are critical for relaying nerve impulses individuals with fxtas have a mutation in which a dna segment known as a cgg triplet repeat is expanded within the fmr1 gene normally this dna segment is repeated from 5 to about 40 times in people with fxtas however the cgg segment is repeated 55 to 200 times this mutation is known as an fmr1 gene premutation an expansion of more than 200 repeats a full mutation causes a more serious condition called fragile x syndrome which is characterized by intellectual disability learning problems and certain physical features for unknown reasons the premutation leads to the overproduction of abnormal fmr1 mrna that contains the expanded repeat region the fmr1mrna is the genetic blueprint for the production of fmrp researchers believe that the high levels of mrna cause the signs and symptoms of fxtas the mrna has been found in clumps of proteins and mrna intranuclear inclusions in brain and nerve cells in people with fxtas it is thought that attaching to fmr1 mrna and forming clumps keeps the other proteins from performing their functions although the effect of the intranuclear inclusions is unclear in addition the repeat expansion makes producing fmrp from the mrna blueprint more difficult and as a result people with the fmr1 gene premutation can have less fmrp than normal a reduction in the protein is not thought to be involved in fxtas however it may cause mild versions of the features seen in fragile x syndrome such as prominent ears anxiety and mood swings,"fragile x syndrome, anxiety",,,"Anxiety, Fragile X Syndrome",,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors three types of standard treatment are used radiation therapy chemotherapy surgery new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors different types of treatments are available for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment three types of standard treatment are used radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat seminoma chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated surgery patients who have benign tumors or tumor remaining after chemotherapy or radiation therapy may need to have surgery new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the body s blood cells patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see

african americans alaska natives american indians asian americans hispanics latinos and pacific islander americans dpp participants also included others at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes such as women with a history of gestational diabetes and people age 60 and older approaches to preventing diabetes the dpp tested three approaches to preventing diabetes making lifestyle changes people in the lifestyle change group exercised usually by walking 5 days a week for about 30 minutes a day and lowered their intake of fat and calories taking the diabetes medicine metformin those who took metformin also received information about physical activity and diet receiving education about diabetes the third group only received information about physical activity and diet and took a placeboa pill without medicine in it people in the lifestyle change group showed the best outcomes but people who took metformin also benefited the results showed that by losing an average of 15 pounds in the first year of the study people in the lifestyle change group reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent over 3 years lifestyle change was even more effective in those age 60 and older people in this group reduced their risk by 71 percent but people in the metformin group also benefited reducing their risk by 31 percent more information about the dpp funded under national institutes of health nih clinical trial number nct00004992 is available at www bsc gwu edu dpp lasting results the diabetes prevention program outcomes study dppos has shown that the benefits of weight loss and metformin last for at least 10 years the dppos has continued to follow most dpp participants since the dpp ended in 2001 the dppos showed that 10 years after enrolling in the dpp people in the lifestyle change group reduced their risk for developing diabetes by 34 percent those in the lifestyle change group age 60 or older had even greater benefit reducing their risk of developing diabetes by 49 percent participants in the lifestyle change group also had fewer heart and blood vessel disease risk factors including lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels even though they took fewer medicines to control their heart disease risk the metformin group reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 18 percent even though controlling your weight with lifestyle changes is challenging it produces long term health rewards by lowering your risk for type 2 diabetes lowering your blood glucose levels and reducing other heart disease risk factors more information about the dppos funded under nih clinical trial number nct00038727 can be found at www bsc gwu edu dpp other types of diabetes in addition to type 2 the other main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes formerly called juvenile diabetes is usually first diagnosed in children teenagers and young adults in this type of diabetes your pancreas can no longer make insulin because your bodys immune system has attacked and destroyed the cells that make it treatment for type 1 diabetes includes taking insulin shots or using an insulin pump making wise food choices being physically active on a regular basis controlling blood pressure and cholesterol and for some taking aspirin daily gestational diabetes gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy hormones produced by your placenta and other pregnancy related factors contribute to insulin resistance which occurs in all women during late pregnancy insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels if your pancreas cant produce enough insulin gestational diabetes occurs as with type 2 diabetes excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk gestational diabetes occurs more often in some ethnic groups and among women with a family history of diabetes although gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born a woman who has had gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life babies born to mothers who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes as they grow up,"diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, cholesterol",,,"Diabetes, Prediabetes, Cholesterol, Obesity",,

several types of surgery to treat cardiomyopathy including septal myectomy surgically implanted devices and heart transplant septal myectomy septal myectomy is open heart surgery and is used to treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms this surgery generally is used for younger patients and for people whose medicines arent working well a surgeon removes part of the thickened septum thats bulging into the left ventricle this improves blood flow through the heart and out to the body the removed tissue doesnt grow back if needed the surgeon also can repair or replace the mitral valve at the same time septal myectomy often is successful and allows you to return to a normal life with nosymptoms surgically implanted devices surgeons can place several types of devices in the heart to improve function and symptoms including cardiac resynchronization therapy crt device a crt device coordinates contractions between the hearts left and right ventricles implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd an icd helps control life threatening arrhythmias that may lead tosudden cardiac arrest this small device is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart with wires if an icd senses a dangerous change in heart rhythm it will send an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat left ventricular assist device lvad this device helps the heart pump blood to the body an lvad can be used as a long term therapy or as a short term treatment for people who are waiting for a heart transplant pacemaker this small device is placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control arrhythmias the device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate heart transplant for this surgery a surgeon replaces a persons diseased heart with a healthy heart from a deceased donor a heart transplant is a last resort treatment for people who have end stage heart failure end stage means the condition has become so severe that all treatments other than heart transplant have failed for more information about this treatment go to the heart transplant health topic nonsurgical procedure doctors may use a nonsurgical procedure called alcohol septal ablation to treat cardiomyopathy during this procedure the doctor injects ethanol a type of alcohol through a tube into the small artery that supplies blood to the thickened area of heart muscle the alcohol kills cells and the thickened tissue shrinks to a more normal size this procedure allows blood to flow freely through the ventricle which improves

mutations in the mecp2 gene cause mecp2 related severe neonatal encephalopathy the mecp2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mecp2 that is critical for normal brain function researchers believe that this protein has several functions including regulating other genes in the brain by switching them on or off as they are needed the mecp2 protein likely plays a role in maintaining the normal function of nerve cells which ensures that connections synapses between these cells form properly the mecp2 protein may also control the production of different versions of certain proteins in nerve cells although mutations in the mecp2 gene disrupt the normal function of nerve cells it is unclear how these mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of mecp2 related severe neonatal encephalopathy,,,,,,

find any damage to your heart and check how well your heart pumps blood early diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer more active lives medical and family histories your doctor will ask whether you or others in your family have or have had a disease or condition that can cause heart failure your doctor also will ask about your symptoms he or she will want to know which symptoms you have when they occur how long you ve had them and how severe they are your answers will help show whether and how much your symptoms limit your daily routine physical exam during the physical exam your doctor will listen to your heart for sounds that aren t normal listen to your lungs for the sounds of extra fluid buildup look for swelling in your ankles feet legs abdomen and the veins in your neck diagnostic tests no single test can diagnose heart failure if you have signs and symptoms of heart failure your doctor may recommend one or more tests your doctor also may refer you to a cardiologist a cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions ekg electrocardiogram an ekg is a simple painless test that detects and records the heart s electrical activity the test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart an ekg may show whether the walls in your heart s pumping chambers are thicker than normal thicker walls can make it harder for your heart to pump blood an ekg also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack chest x ray a chest x raytakes pictures of the structures inside your chest such as your heart lungs and blood vessels this test can show whether your heart is enlarged you have fluid in your lungs or you have lung disease bnp blood test this test checks the level of a hormone in your blood called bnp the level of this hormone rises during heart failure echocardiography echocardiography echo uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart the test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves work echo also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart areas of heart muscle that aren t contracting normally and heart muscle damage caused by lack of blood flow echo might be done before and after a stress test see below a stress echo can show how well blood is flowing through your heart the test also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats doppler ultrasound a doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure the speed and direction of blood flow this test often is done with echo to give a more complete picture of blood flow to the heart and lungs doctors often use doppler ultrasound to help diagnose right side heart failure holter monitor a holter monitor records your heart s electrical activity for a full 24 or 48 hour period while you go about your normal daily

nuclear heart scan a nuclear heart scan shows how well blood is flowing through your heart and how much blood is reaching your heart muscle during a nuclear heart scan a safe radioactive substance called a tracer is injected into your bloodstream through a vein the tracer travels to your heart and releases energy special cameras outside of your body detect the energy and use it to create pictures of your heart a nuclear heart scan can show where the heart muscle is healthy and where it s damaged a positron emission tomography pet scan is a type of nuclear heart scan it shows the level of chemical activity in areas of your heart this test can help your doctor see whether enough blood is flowing to these areas a pet scan can show blood flow problems that other tests might not detect cardiac catheterization during cardiac catheterization kath eh ter ih za shun a long thin flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm groin upper thigh or neck and threaded to your heart this allows your doctor to look inside your coronary heart arteries during this procedure your doctor can check the pressure and blood flow in your heart chambers collect blood samples and use x rays to look at your coronary arteries coronary angiography coronary angiography an jee og rah fee usually is done with cardiac catheterization a dye that can be seen on x ray is injected into your bloodstream through the tip of the catheter the dye allows your doctor to see the flow of blood to your heart muscle angiography also shows how well your heart is pumping stress test some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast during stress testing you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast you may walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle if you can t exercise you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate heart tests such as nuclear heart scanning and echo often are done during stress testing cardiac mri cardiac mri magnetic resonance imaging uses radio waves magnets and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it s beating the test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels a cardiac mri can show whether parts of your heart are damaged doctors also have used mri in research studies to find early signs of heart failure even before symptoms appear thyroid function

osteoglophonic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the fgfr1 gene which provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 this protein is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors which are related proteins that bind attach to other proteins called fibroblast growth factors the growth factors and their receptors are involved in important processes such as cell division regulation of cell growth and maturation formation of blood vessels wound healing and embryonic development in particular they play a major role in skeletal development the fgfr1 protein spans the cell membrane so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell when a fibroblast growth factor binds to the part of the fgfr1 protein outside the cell the receptor triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes such as maturing to take on specialized functions the fgfr1 protein is thought to play an important role in the development of the nervous system this protein may also help regulate the growth of long bones such as the large bones in the arms and legs fgfr1 gene mutations that cause osteoglophonic dysplasia change single building blocks amino acids in the fgfr1 protein the altered fgfr1 protein appears to cause prolonged signaling which promotes premature fusion of bones in the skull and disrupts the regulation of bone growth in the arms and legs,osteoglophonic dysplasia,,,Osteoglophonic dysplasia,,

autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia is caused by mutations in the cyb5r3 gene this gene provides instruction for making an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase 3 this enzyme is involved in transferring negatively charged particles called electrons from one molecule to another two versions isoforms of this enzyme are produced from the cyb5r3 gene the soluble isoform is present only in red blood cells and the membrane bound isoform is found in all other cell types each hemoglobin molecule contains four iron atoms which are needed to carry oxygen in normal red blood cells the iron in hemoglobin is ferrous fe2 but it can spontaneously become ferric fe3 when hemoglobin contains ferric iron it is methemoglobin the soluble isoform of cytochrome b5 reductase 3 changes ferric iron back to ferrous iron so hemoglobin can deliver oxygen to tissues normally red blood cells contain less than 2 percent methemoglobin the membrane bound isoform is widely used in the body this isoform is necessary for many chemical reactions including the breakdown and formation of fatty acids the formation of cholesterol and the breakdown of various molecules and drugs cyb5r3 gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type i typically reduce enzyme activity or stability as a result the enzyme cannot efficiently change ferric iron to ferrous iron leading to a 10 to 50 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells this increase in methemoglobin and the corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues the altered enzyme activity affects only red blood cells because other cells can compensate for a decrease in enzyme activity but red blood cells cannot mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type ii usually result in a complete loss of enzyme activity cells cannot compensate for a complete loss of this enzyme which results in a 10 to 70 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells this increase in methemoglobin and the corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin leads to cyanosis the lack of enzyme activity in other cells leads to the neurological features associated with type ii researchers suspect that the neurological problems are caused by impaired fatty acid and cholesterol formation which reduces the production of a fatty substance called myelin myelin insulates nerve cells and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses this reduced ability to form myelin hypomyelination leads to a loss of nerve cells particularly in the brain the loss of these cells likely contributes to the encephalopathy and movement disorders characteristic of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type ii,"cholesterol, movement disorders",,,"Movement Disorders, Cholesterol",,

mutations in the esco2 gene cause roberts syndrome this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for proper chromosome separation during cell division before cells divide they must copy all of their chromosomes the copied dna from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures called sister chromatids the esco2 protein plays an important role in establishing the glue that holds the sister chromatids together until the chromosomes are ready to separate all identified mutations in the esco2 gene prevent the cell from producing any functional esco2 protein which causes some of the glue between sister chromatids to be missing around the chromosome s constriction point centromere in roberts syndrome cells respond to abnormal sister chromatid attachment by delaying cell division delayed cell division can be a signal that the cell should undergo self destruction the signs and symptoms of roberts syndrome may result from the loss of cells from various tissues during early development because both mildly and severely affected individuals lack any functional esco2 protein the underlying cause of the variation in disease severity remains unknown researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved,roberts syndrome,,,Roberts syndrome,,

body the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease treatment is based on the stage and other factors that affect prognosis the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the neck chest abdomen or pelvis taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do sometimes a pet scan and a ct scan are done at the same time if there is any cancer this increases the chance that it will be found mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a

mutations in the oat gene cause gyrate atrophy the oat gene provides instructions for making the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase this enzyme is active in the energy producing centers of cells mitochondria where it helps break down a molecule called ornithine ornithine is involved in the urea cycle which processes excess nitrogen in the form of ammonia that is generated when protein is broken down by the body in addition to its role in the urea cycle ornithine participates in several reactions that help ensure the proper balance of protein building blocks amino acids in the body this balance is important because a specific sequence of amino acids is required to build each of the many different proteins needed for the body s functions the ornithine aminotransferase enzyme helps convert ornithine into another molecule called pyrroline 5 carboxylate p5c p5c can be converted into the amino acids glutamate and proline oat gene mutations that cause gyrate atrophy result in a reduced amount of functional ornithine aminotransferase enzyme a shortage of this enzyme impedes the conversion of ornithine into p5c as a result excess ornithine accumulates in the blood hyperornithinemia and less p5c than normal is produced it is not clear how these changes result in the specific signs and symptoms of gyrate atrophy researchers have suggested that a deficiency of p5c may interfere with the function of the retina it has also been proposed that excess ornithine may suppress the production of a molecule called creatine creatine is needed for many tissues in the body to store and use energy properly it is involved in providing energy for muscle contraction and it is also important in nervous system functioning,,,,,,
22q13 3 deletion syndrome also known as phelan mcdermid syndrome is a chromosome abnormality caused by the loss deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22 the deletion occurs near the end of the long arm or q arm at a location designated as q13 3 the signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely from person to person common symptoms include low muscle tone hypotonia intellectual disability delayed or absent speech abnormal growth tendency to overheat large hands and abnormal toenails affected individuals may have characteristic behaviors such as mouthing or chewing on non food items decreased perception of pain and autistic like behaviors the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22 called the shank3 gene is likely responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of 22q13 3 deletion syndrome additional genes within the deleted region probably contribute to the variable features of the syndrome,pain,,,"Pain, 22q13.3 deletion syndrome",,
adenosine deaminase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ada gene this gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme adenosine deaminase this enzyme is found throughout the body but is most active in specialized white blood cells called lymphocytes these cells protect the body against potentially harmful invaders such as bacteria and viruses by making immune proteins called antibodies or by directly attacking infected cells lymphocytes are produced in specialized lymphoid tissues including the thymus which is a gland located behind the breastbone and lymph nodes which are found throughout the body lymphocytes in the blood and in lymphoid tissues make up the immune system the function of the adenosine deaminase enzyme is to eliminate a molecule called deoxyadenosine which is generated when dna is broken down adenosine deaminase converts deoxyadenosine which can be toxic to lymphocytes to another molecule called deoxyinosine that is not harmful mutations in the ada gene reduce or eliminate the activity of adenosine deaminase and allow the buildup of deoxyadenosine to levels that are toxic to lymphocytes immature lymphocytes in the thymus are particularly vulnerable to a toxic buildup of deoxyadenosine these cells die before they can mature to help fight infection the number of lymphocytes in other lymphoid tissues is also greatly reduced the loss of infection fighting cells results in the signs and symptoms of scid,,,,,,

medication must be given within 4 hours of symptom onset the sooner treatment occurs the better your chances of recovery if you think youre having a stroke call 911 right away for emergency care medicines to prevent blood clots are the mainstay treatment for people who have carotid artery disease they prevent platelets from clumping together and forming blood clots in your carotid arteries which can lead to a stroke two common medications are aspirin clopidogrel sometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels for example you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol by lowering your blood cholesterol level you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have diabetes heart disease or have had a stroke high ldl cholesterol levels doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke you may need other medications to treat diseases and conditions that damage the carotid arteries your doctor also may prescribe medications to lower your blood pressure lower your blood sugar level prevent blood clots from forming which can lead to stroke prevent or reduce inflammation take all medicines regularly as your doctor prescribes dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to your health care team will help find a treatment plan thats right for you medical procedures you may need a medical procedure if you have symptoms caused by the narrowing of the carotid artery doctors use one of two methods to open narrowed or blocked carotid arteries carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery angioplasty and stenting carotid endarterectomy carotid endarterectomy is mainly for people whose carotid arteries are blocked 50percent ormore for the procedure a surgeon will make a cut in your neck to reach the narrowed or blocked carotid artery next he or she will make a cut in the blocked part of the artery and remove the arterys inner lining that is blocking the blood flow finally your surgeon will close the artery with stitches and stop any bleeding he or she will then close the cut in your neck carotid endarterectomy carotid artery angioplasty and stenting doctors use a procedure called angioplasty to widen the carotid arteries and restore blood flow to the brain a thin tube with a deflated balloon on the end is threaded through a blood vessel in your neck to the narrowed or blocked carotid artery once in place the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery a stent a small mesh tube is then put in the artery to support the inner artery wall the stent also helps prevent the artery from becoming narrowed or blocked again carotid artery stenting,"carotid artery disease, stroke, stress, cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, blood clots,

choosing treatment there are a number of ways to treat prostate cancer and the doctor will develop a treatment to fit each man s needs the choice of treatment mostly depends on the stage of the disease and the grade of the tumor but doctors also consider a man s age general health and his feelings about the treatments and their possible side effects treatment for prostate cancer may involve watchful waiting surgery radiation therapy or hormonal therapy some men receive a combination of therapies a cure is the goal for men whose prostate cancer is diagnosed early weighing treatment options you and your doctor will want to consider both the benefits and possible side effects of each option especially the effects on sexual activity and urination and other concerns about quality of life surgery radiation therapy and hormonal therapy all have the potential to disrupt sexual desire or performance for a short while or permanently discuss your concerns with your health care provider several options are available to help you manage sexual problems related to prostate cancer treatment watchful waiting the doctor may suggest watchful waiting for some men who have prostate cancer that is found at an early stage and appears to be growing slowly also watchful waiting may be advised for older men or men with other serious medical problems for these men the risks and possible side effects of surgery radiation therapy or hormonal therapy may outweigh the possible benefits doctors monitor these patients with regular check ups if symptoms appear or get worse the doctor may recommend active treatment surgery surgery is used to remove the cancer it is a common treatment for early stage prostate cancer the surgeon may remove the entire prostate with a type of surgery called radical prostatectomy or in some cases remove only part of it sometimes the surgeon will also remove nearby lymph nodes side effects of the operation may include lack of sexual function or impotence or problems holding urine or incontinence improvements in surgery now make it possible for some men to keep their sexual function in some cases doctors can use a technique known as nerve sparing surgery this may save the nerves that control erection however men with large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves may not be able to have this surgery some men with trouble holding urine may regain control within several weeks of surgery others continue to have problems that require them to wear a pad radiation therapy radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors doctors may recommend it instead of surgery or after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that may remain in the area in advanced stages the doctor may recommend radiation to relieve pain or other symptoms it may also be used in combination with hormonal therapy radiation can cause problems with impotence and bowel function the radiation may come from a machine which is external radiation or from tiny radioactive seeds placed inside or near the tumor which is internal radiation men who receive only the radioactive seeds usually have small tumors some men receive both kinds of radiation therapy for external radiation therapy patients go to the hospital or clinic usually for several weeks internal radiation may require patients to stay in the hospital for a short time hormonal therapy hormonal therapy deprives cancer cells of the male hormones they need to grow and survive this treatment is often used for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body sometimes doctors use hormonal therapy to try to keep the cancer from coming back after surgery or radiation treatment side effects can include impotence hot flashes loss of sexual desire and thinning of bones some hormone therapies increase the risk of blood clots monitoring treatment regardless of the type of treatment you receive you will be closely monitored to see how well the treatment is working monitoring may include a psa blood test usually every 3 months to 1 year bone scan and or ct scan to see if the cancer has spread a complete blood count to monitor for signs and symptoms of anemia looking for signs or symptoms that the disease might be progressing such as fatigue increased pain or decreased bowel and bladder function a psa blood test usually every 3 months to 1 year bone scan and or ct scan to see if the cancer has spread a complete blood count to monitor for signs and symptoms of anemia looking for signs or symptoms that the disease might be progressing such as fatigue increased pain or decreased bowel and bladder function,"prostate cancer, cancer, pain, blood clots, anemia, fatigue","surgery, radiation therapy",,"Prostate Cancer, Fatigue, Blood Clots, Cancer, Pain, Anemia","Radiation Therapy, Surgery, X-Rays",
the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not well understood however it occurs mainly in older men benign prostatic hyperplasia does not develop in men whose testicles were removed before puberty for this reason some researchers believe factors related to aging and the testicles may cause benign prostatic hyperplasia throughout their lives men produce testosterone a male hormone and small amounts of estrogen a female hormone as men age the amount of active testosterone in their blood decreases which leaves a higher proportion of estrogen scientific studies have suggested that benign prostatic hyperplasia may occur because the higher proportion of estrogen within the prostate increases the activity of substances that promote prostate cell growth another theory focuses on dihydrotestosterone dht a male hormone that plays a role in prostate development and growth some research has indicated that even with a drop in blood testosterone levels older men continue to produce and accumulate high levels of dht in the prostate this accumulation of dht may encourage prostate cells to continue to grow scientists have noted that men who do not produce dht do not develop benign prostatic hyperplasia,,,,,,
how is klippel feil syndrome diagnosed klippel feil syndrome kfs is typically diagnosed when x rays or other imaging techniques show fusion of cervical vertebrae x rays of the entire spine should be performed to detect other spinal abnormalities and additional imaging studies may be needed to assess the extent of the abnormality kfs can be associated with a wide range of other abnormalities involving many parts of the body therefore other initial exams are needed to detect additional physical abnormalities or underlying conditions these include examination of the chest to rule out involvement of the heart and lungs examination of the chest wall to detect possible rib anomalies mri for spinal stenosis or neurological deficits ultrasound of the kidneys for renal abnormalities hearing evaluation due to high incidence of hearing loss various lab tests to assess organ function additional tests or consultations with specialists may be recommended depending on the features present in each person with kfs,"klippel feil syndrome, spinal stenosis, hearing loss",ultrasound,,"Hearing Loss, Spinal Stenosis, Klippel Feil syndrome","Ultrasound, X-Rays",

of treatment are being tested in clinical trials patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment good prognosis for nonseminoma all of the following must be true the tumor is found only in the testicle or in the retroperitoneum area outside or behind the abdominal wall and the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs and the levels of all the tumor markers are slightly above normal for seminoma all of the following must be true the

types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery to remove the testicle inguinal orchiectomy and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging see the general information and stages sections of this summary tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for testicular cancer for more information surveillance surveillance is closely following a patient s condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results it is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred come back in surveillance patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored after the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells see drugs approved for testicular cancer for more information new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials information about clinical trials is available from the nci website patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle a patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away long term clinical exams are very important the patient

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic nets six types of standard treatment are used surgery chemotherapy hormone therapy hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization targeted therapy supportive care new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic nets different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors nets some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment six types of standard treatment are used surgery an operation may be done to remove the tumor one of the following types of surgery may be used enucleation surgery to remove the tumor only this may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas pancreatoduodenectomy a surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas the gallbladder nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach small intestine and bile duct are removed enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin the organs removed during this procedure depend on the patient s condition this is also called the whipple procedure distal pancreatectomy surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas the spleen may also be removed total gastrectomy surgery to remove the whole stomach parietal cell vagotomy surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid liver resection surgery to remove part or all of the liver radiofrequency ablation the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed in other cases the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen this is done in the hospital with general anesthesia cryosurgical ablation a procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells this is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide the instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin this procedure is also called cryoablation chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated hormone therapy hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach receptors drugs surgery or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs small particles or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver this is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver the tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow the liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein which carries blood from the stomach and intestine chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization the anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter thin tube the drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and cuts off blood flow to the tumor most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body the blockage may be temporary or permanent depending on the substance used to block the artery targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic nets supportive care supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment supportive care for pancreatic nets may include treatment for the following stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole lansoprazole or pantoprazole histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine ranitidine or famotidine somatostatin type drugs such as octreotide diarrhea may be treated with intravenous iv fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride somatostatin type drugs such as octreotide low blood sugar may be treated by having small frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level high blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials information about clinical trials is available from the nci website patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors gastrinoma treatment of gastrinoma may include supportive care and the following for symptoms caused by too

cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes specifically those that control cell growth and division or the repair of damaged dna these changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor in most cases of prostate cancer these genetic changes are acquired during a man s lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the prostate these changes which are called somatic mutations are not inherited somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in prostate cancer cells less commonly genetic changes present in essentially all of the body s cells increase the risk of developing prostate cancer these genetic changes which are classified as germline mutations are usually inherited from a parent in people with germline mutations changes in other genes together with environmental and lifestyle factors also influence whether a person will develop prostate cancer inherited mutations in particular genes such as brca1 brca2 and hoxb13 account for some cases of hereditary prostate cancer men with mutations in these genes have a high risk of developing prostate cancer and in some cases other cancers during their lifetimes in addition men with brca2 or hoxb13 gene mutations may have a higher risk of developing life threatening forms of prostate cancer the proteins produced from the brca1 and brca2 genes are involved in fixing damaged dna which helps to maintain the stability of a cell s genetic information for this reason the brca1 and brca2 proteins are considered to be tumor suppressors which means that they help keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way mutations in these genes impair the cell s ability to fix damaged dna allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist as these defects accumulate they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor the hoxb13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches binds to specific regions of dna and regulates the activity of other genes on the basis of this role the protein produced from the hoxb13 gene is called a transcription factor like brca1 and brca2 the hoxb13 protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor hoxb13 gene mutations may result in impairment of the protein s tumor suppressor function resulting in the uncontrolled cell growth and division that can lead to prostate cancer inherited variations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for prostate cancer some of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact with the proteins produced from the brca1 brca2 or hoxb13 genes others act as tumor suppressors through different pathways changes in these genes probably make only a small contribution to overall prostate cancer risk however researchers suspect that the combined influence of variations in many of these genes may significantly impact a person s risk of developing this form of cancer in many families the genetic changes associated with hereditary prostate cancer are unknown identifying additional genetic risk factors for prostate cancer is an active area of medical research in addition to genetic changes researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that may contribute to a person s risk of developing prostate cancer these factors include a high fat diet that includes an excess of meat and dairy and not enough vegetables a largely inactive sedentary lifestyle obesity excessive alcohol use or exposure to certain toxic chemicals a history of prostate cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor particularly if the cancer occurred at an early age,"prostate cancer, cancer, obesity",,,"Prostate Cancer, Cancer, Obesity",,

myh9 related disorder is caused by mutations in the myh9 gene the myh9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin 9 this protein is one part subunit of the myosin iia protein there are three forms of myosin ii called myosin iia myosin iib and myosin iic the three forms are found throughout the body and perform similar functions they play roles in cell movement cell motility maintenance of cell shape and cytokinesis which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus the cytoplasm divides to form two separate cells while some cells use more than one type of myosin ii certain blood cells such as platelets and white blood cells leukocytes use only myosin iia myh9 gene mutations that cause myh9 related disorder typically result in a nonfunctional version of the myosin 9 protein the nonfunctional protein cannot properly interact with other subunits to form myosin iia platelets and leukocytes which only use myosin iia are most affected by a lack of functional myosin 9 it is thought that a lack of functional myosin iia leads to the release of large immature platelets in the bloodstream resulting in a reduced amount of normal platelets in leukocytes the nonfunctional myosin 9 clumps together these clumps of protein called inclusion bodies are a hallmark of myh9 related disorder and are present in the leukocytes of everyone with this condition,,,,,,

treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis depends on how early a health care provider diagnoses the disease and whether complications are present in the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis treatment can slow the progression of liver damage to cirrhosis in the early stages of cirrhosis the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications as cirrhosis progresses a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications medications health care providers prescribe ursodiol actigall urso to treat primary biliary cirrhosis ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver which are more toxic and can harm the liver treatment with ursodiol can reduce levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes in the blood early treatment with this medication reduces the likelihood of needing a liver transplant and improves survival 3 early treatment provides the most benefit however ursodiol treatment late in the course of the disease can still slow the progression of liver damage while ursodiol treatment improves the outcome of primary biliary cirrhosis it does not cure the disease researchers are studying the effects of several other medications on the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis to date none has shown the positive effects of ursodiol avoiding alcohol and other substances people with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances as both will cause more liver damage people with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications such as herbs people with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications over the counter medications or vitamins many vitamins and prescription and over the counter medications can affect liver function treatment of symptoms and complications health care providers treat symptoms and complications as follows itching antihistamines may help with mild itching however antihistamines often cause drowsiness and a person should take antihistamines just before bedtime to help with nighttime itching a health care provider will treat more problematic itching with cholestyramine locholest questran which reduces cholesterol in the blood experts believe high levels of cholesterol let substances that cause itching build up in tissues dry eyes and mouth health care providers usually treat dry eyes and mouth with artificial tears and saliva substitutes respectively these products are available without a prescription a health care provider may treat people whose symptoms do not improve with pilocarpine salagen or cevimeline evoxac people who have difficulty with dry eyes should see an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersregularly people with dry mouth should have regular dental exams portal hypertension a health care provider may prescribe a beta blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension beta blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload varices beta blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy this procedure involves using an endoscope to look for varices the health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off a gastroenterologist performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center people who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes edema and ascites health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites a health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis a health care provider may prescribe bacteria fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection he or she may prescribe oral antibiotics however severe infection with ascites requires intravenous iv antibiotics hepatic encephalopathy a health care provider will treat hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum a health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled osteoporosis a health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density gallstones and bile duct stones a health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones he or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which uses balloons and basketlike devices to retrieve the bile duct stones liver cancer a health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early health care providers use blood tests ultrasound or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis he or she may treat cancer with a combination of surgery radiation and

african iron overload was first noted in rural central and southern african populations among people who drink a traditional beer brewed in uncoated steel drums that allow iron a component of steel to leach into the beer however not all individuals who drink the beer develop african iron overload and not all individuals of african descent with iron overload drink the beer therefore researchers are seeking genetic differences that affect the risk of developing this condition some studies have indicated that a variation in the slc40a1 gene increases the risk of developing increased iron stores in people of african descent this variation is found in 5 to 20 percent of people of african descent but is not generally found in other populations the slc40a1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ferroportin this protein is involved in the process of iron absorption in the body iron from the diet is absorbed through the walls of the small intestine ferroportin then transports iron from the small intestine into the bloodstream and the iron is carried by the blood to the tissues and organs of the body ferroportin also transports iron out of reticuloendothelial cells in the liver spleen and bone marrow the amount of iron absorbed by the body depends on the amount of iron stored and released from intestinal cells and macrophages the slc40a1 gene variation that some studies have associated with increased iron stores in people of african descent may affect the way ferroportin helps to regulate iron absorption in the body however researchers suggest that this variation is not associated with most cases of african iron overload,,,,,,

metatropic dysplasia is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because one mutated copy of the trpv4 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition most cases of metatropic dysplasia are caused by new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family in a few reported cases an affected person has inherited the condition from an affected parent in the past it was thought that the lethal type of metatropic dysplasia had an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance in which both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations however more recent research has confirmed that all metatropic dysplasia has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance,,,,,,

area around it the process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the pancreas is called staging tests and procedures to detect diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time in order to plan treatment it is important to know the stage of the disease and whether or not the pancreatic cancer can be removed by surgery the following tests and procedures may be used physical exam and history an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken blood chemistry studies a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as bilirubin released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease tumor marker test a procedure in which a sample of blood urine or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances such as ca 19 9 and carcinoembryonic antigen cea made by organs tissues or tumor cells in the body certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body these are called tumor markers mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography a spiral or helical ct scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do a pet scan and ct scan may be done at the same time this is called a pet ct abdominal ultrasound an ultrasound exam used to make pictures of the inside of the abdomen the ultrasound transducer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs high energy sound waves ultrasound into the abdomen the sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and organs and make echoes the transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms the picture can be printed to be looked at later endoscopic ultrasound eus a procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body usually through the mouth or rectum an endoscope is a thin tube like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing a probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high energy sound waves ultrasound off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram this procedure is also called endosonography endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp a procedure used to x ray the ducts tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile causing jaundice an endoscope a thin lighted tube is passed through the mouth esophagus and stomach into the first part of the small intestine a catheter a smaller tube is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts a dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x ray is taken if the ducts are blocked by a tumor a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it this tube or stent may be left in place to keep the duct open tissue samples may also be taken percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ptc a procedure used to x ray the liver and bile ducts a thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x ray is taken if a blockage is found a thin flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body this test is done only if ercp cannot be done laparoscopy a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease small incisions cuts are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope a thin lighted tube is inserted into one of the incisions the laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce high energy sound waves off internal organs such as the pancreas this is called laparoscopic ultrasound other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of fluid from the abdomen to check for cancer biopsy the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer there are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer a fine needle or a core needle may be inserted into the pancreas during an x ray or ultrasound to remove cells tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy,"pancreatic cancer, cancer, jaundice","surgery, ultrasound,

congenital dyserythropoietic anemia cda is an inherited blood disorder that affects the development of red blood cells this disorder is one of many types of anemia which is a condition characterized by a shortage of red blood cells this shortage prevents the blood from carrying an adequate supply of oxygen to the body s tissues the resulting symptoms can include tiredness fatigue weakness pale skin and other complications researchers have identified three major types of cda type i type ii and type iii the types have different genetic causes and different but overlapping patterns of signs and symptoms cda type i is characterized by moderate to severe anemia it is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence although in some cases the condition can be detected before birth many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes jaundice and an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly this condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron which builds up and can damage tissues and organs in particular iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm arrhythmia congestive heart failure diabetes and chronic liver disease cirrhosis rarely people with cda type i are born with skeletal abnormalities most often involving the fingers and or toes the anemia associated with cda type ii can range from mild to severe and most affected individuals have jaundice hepatosplenomegaly and the formation of hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones this form of the disorder is usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood an abnormal buildup of iron typically occurs after age 20 leading to complications including heart disease diabetes and cirrhosis the signs and symptoms of cda type iii tend to be milder than those of the other types most affected individuals do not have hepatosplenomegaly and iron does not build up in tissues and organs in adulthood abnormalities of a specialized tissue at the back of the eye the retina can cause vision impairment some people with cda type iii also have a blood disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy which can lead to a cancer of white blood cells multiple myeloma several other variants of cda have been described although they appear to be rare and not much is known about them once researchers discover the genetic causes of these variants some of them may be grouped with the three major types of cda,"anemia, fatigue, jaundice, arrhythmia, heart failure, diabetes, cirrhosis, gallstones, cancer, multiple myeloma",,,"Diabetes, Heart Failure, Gallstones, Fatigue, Jaundice, Cirrhosis, Multiple Myeloma, Cancer, Arrhythmia, Anemia",,
ovarian cancer is a disease that affects women in this form of cancer certain cells in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor the ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced in about 90 percent of cases ovarian cancer occurs after age 40 and most cases occur after age 60 the most common form of ovarian cancer begins in epithelial cells which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body these cancers can arise in the epithelial cells on the surface of the ovary however researchers suggest that many or even most ovarian cancers begin in epithelial cells on the fringes fimbriae at the end of one of the fallopian tubes and the cancerous cells migrate to the ovary cancer can also begin in epithelial cells that form the lining of the abdomen the peritoneum this form of cancer called primary peritoneal cancer resembles epithelial ovarian cancer in its origin symptoms progression and treatment primary peritoneal cancer often spreads to the ovaries it can also occur even if the ovaries have been removed because cancers that begin in the ovaries fallopian tubes and peritoneum are so similar and spread easily from one of these structures to the others they are often difficult to distinguish these cancers are so closely related that they are generally considered collectively by experts in about 10 percent of cases ovarian cancer develops not in epithelial cells but in germ cells which are precursors to egg cells or in hormone producing ovarian cells called granulosa cells in its early stages ovarian cancer usually does not cause noticeable symptoms as the cancer progresses signs and symptoms can include pain or a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis or lower abdomen bloating feeling full quickly when eating back pain vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or after menopause or changes in urinary or bowel habits however these changes can occur as part of many different conditions having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a woman has ovarian cancer in some cases cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body if ovarian cancer spreads cancerous tumors most often appear in the abdominal cavity or on the surfaces of nearby organs such as the bladder or colon tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers some ovarian cancers cluster in families these cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations hereditary ovarian cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non inherited sporadic cases because it is often diagnosed at a late stage ovarian cancer can be difficult to treat it leads to the deaths of about 140 000 women annually more than any other gynecological cancer however when it is diagnosed and treated early the 5 year survival rate is high,"ovarian cancer, cancer, pain, back pain, vaginal bleeding, menopause, gynecological cancer",,,"Bleeding, Menopause, Ovarian Cancer, Vaginal Bleeding, Cancer, Back Pain, Pain",,

a number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease it may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body like diabetes or lupus many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease the categories presented below can overlap that is a disease might belong to two or more of the categories for example diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories systemic diseases since diabetes itself is a systemic disease and sclerotic diseases because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring autoimmune diseases when the body s immune system functions properly it creates protein like substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms in an autoimmune disease the immune system creates autoantibodies which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body or they may affect only specific organs or regions systemic lupus erythematosus sle affects many parts of the body primarily the skin and joints but also the kidneys because women are more likely to develop sle than men some researchers believe that a sex linked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by sle and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli causing inflammation ultimately the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs cyclophosphamide a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system and prednisolone a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation a newer immunosuppressant mychophenolate mofetil mmf has been used instead of cyclophosphamide preliminary studies indicate that mmf may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects goodpasture s syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs often the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood but lung damage in goodpasture s syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys goodpasture s syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women children and older adults treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a blood cleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies iga nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin a iga forms deposits in the glomeruli where it creates inflammation iga nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late 1960s when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify iga deposits in kidney tissue the most common symptom of iga nephropathy is blood in the urine but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years the silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of iga nephropathy when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it this disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus it appears to affect men more than women although iga nephropathy is found in all age groups young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications no treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of iga nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than 1 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine output when proteinuria exceeds 1 gram day treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs that block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously hereditary nephritisalport syndrome the primary indicator of alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment this syndrome affects both men and women but men are more likely to experience chronic kidney disease and sensory loss men with alport syndrome usually first show evidence of renal insufficiency while in their twenties and reach total kidney failure by age 40 women rarely have significant renal impairment and hearing loss may be so slight that it can be detected only through testing with special equipment usually men can pass the disease only to their daughters women can transmit the disease to either their sons or their daughters treatment focuses on controlling blood pressure to maintain kidney function infection related glomerular disease glomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis psgn can occur after an episode of strep throat or in rare cases impetigo a skin infection the streptococcus bacteria do not attack the kidney directly but an infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies which are circulated in the blood and finally deposited in the glomeruli causing damage psgn can bring on sudden symptoms of swelling edema reduced urine output oliguria and blood in the urine hematuria tests will show large amounts of protein in the urine and elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood thus indicating reduced kidney function high blood pressure frequently accompanies reduced kidney function in this disease psgn is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 7 although it can strike at any age and it most often affects boys it lasts only a brief time and usually allows the kidneys to recover in a few cases however kidney damage may be permanent requiring dialysis or transplantation to replace renal function bacterial endocarditis infection of the tissues inside the heart is also associated with subsequent glomerular disease researchers are not sure whether the renal lesions that form after a heart infection are caused entirely by the immune response or whether some other disease mechanism contributes to kidney damage treating the heart infection is the most effective way of minimizing kidney damage endocarditis sometimes produces chronic kidney disease ckd hiv the virus that leads to aids can also cause glomerular disease between 5 and 10 percent of people with hiv experience kidney failure even before developing full blown aids hiv associated nephropathy usually begins with heavy proteinuria and progresses rapidly within a year of detection to total kidney failure researchers are looking for therapies that can slow down or reverse this rapid deterioration of renal function but some possible solutions involving immunosuppression are risky because of the patients already compromised immune system sclerotic diseases glomerulosclerosis is scarring sclerosis of the glomeruli in several sclerotic conditions a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes is responsible glomerulosclerosis is caused by the activation of glomerular cells to produce scar material this may be stimulated by molecules called growth factors which may be made by glomerular cells themselves or may be brought to the glomerulus by the circulating blood that enters the glomerular filter diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of glomerular disease and of total kidney failure in the united states kidney disease is one of several problems caused by elevated levels of blood glucose the central feature of diabetes in addition to scarring the kidney elevated glucose levels appear to increase the speed of blood flow into the kidney putting a strain on the filtering glomeruli and raising blood pressure diabetic nephropathy usually takes many years to develop people with diabetes can slow down damage to their kidneys by controlling their blood glucose through healthy eating with moderate protein intake physical activity and medications people with diabetes should also be careful to keep their blood pressure at a level below 140 90 mm hg if possible blood pressure medications called ace inhibitors and arbs are particularly effective at minimizing kidney damage and are now frequently prescribed to control blood pressure in patients with diabetes and in patients with many forms of kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs describes scarring in scattered regions of the kidney typically limited to one part of the glomerulus and to a minority of glomeruli in the affected region fsgs may result from a systemic disorder or it may develop as an idiopathic kidney disease without a known cause proteinuria is the most common symptom of fsgs but since proteinuria is associated with several other kidney conditions the doctor cannot diagnose fsgs on the basis of proteinuria alone biopsy may confirm the presence of glomerular scarring if the tissue is taken from the affected section of the kidney but finding the affected section is a matter of chance especially early in the disease process when lesions may be scattered confirming a diagnosis of fsgs may require repeat kidney biopsies arriving at a diagnosis of idiopathic fsgs requires the identification of focal scarring and the elimination of possible systemic causes such as diabetes or an immune response to infection since idiopathic fsgs is by definition of unknown cause it is difficult to treat no universal remedy has been found and most patients with fsgs progress to total kidney failure over 5 to 20 years some patients with an aggressive form of fsgs reach total kidney failure in 2 to 3 years treatments involving steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs appear to help some patients by decreasing proteinuria and improving kidney function but these treatments are beneficial to only a minority of those in whom they are tried and some patients experience even poorer kidney function as a result ace inhibitors and arbs may also be used in fsgs to decrease proteinuria treatment should focus on controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels factors that may contribute to kidney scarring other glomerular diseases membranous nephropathy also called membranous glomerulopathy is the second most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome proteinuria edema high cholesterol in u s adults after diabetic nephropathy diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy which reveals unusual deposits of immunoglobulin g and complement c3 substances created by the body s immune system fully 75 percent of cases are idiopathic which means that the cause of the disease is unknown the remaining 25 percent of cases are the result of other diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus hepatitis b or c infection or some forms of cancer drug therapies involving penicillamine gold or captopril have also been associated with membranous nephropathy about 20 to 40 percent of patients with membranous nephropathy progress usually over decades to total kidney failure but most patients experience either complete remission or continued symptoms without progressive kidney failure doctors disagree about how aggressively to treat this condition since about 20 percent of patients recover without treatment ace inhibitors and arbs are generally used to reduce proteinuria additional medication to control high blood pressure and edema is frequently required some patients benefit from steroids but this treatment does not work for everyone additional immunosuppressive medications are helpful for some patients with progressive disease minimal change disease mcd is the diagnosis given when a patient has the nephrotic syndrome and the kidney biopsy reveals little or no change to the structure of glomeruli or surrounding tissues when examined by a light microscope tiny drops of a fatty substance called a lipid may be present but no scarring has taken place within the kidney mcd may occur at any age but it is most common in childhood a small percentage of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome do not respond to steroid therapy for these patients the doctor may recommend a low sodium diet and prescribe a diuretic to control edema the doctor may recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs to reduce proteinuria ace inhibitors and arbs have also been used to reduce proteinuria in patients with steroid resistant mcd these patients may respond to larger doses of steroids more prolonged use of steroids or steroids in combination with

although the cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown variations in dozens of genes are thought to be involved in multiple sclerosis risk changes in the hla drb1 gene are the strongest genetic risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis other factors associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis include changes in the il7r gene and environmental factors such as exposure to the epstein barr virus low levels of vitamin d and smoking the hla drb1 gene belongs to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen hla complex the hla complex helps the immune system distinguish the body s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria each hla gene has many different normal variations allowing each person s immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins variations in several hla genes have been associated with increased multiple sclerosis risk but one particular variant of the hla drb1 gene called hla drb1 15 01 is the most strongly linked genetic factor the il7r gene provides instructions for making one piece of two different receptor proteins the interleukin 7 il 7 receptor and the thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp receptor both receptors are embedded in the cell membrane of immune cells these receptors stimulate signaling pathways that induce the growth and division proliferation and survival of immune cells the genetic variation involved in multiple sclerosis leads to production of an il 7 receptor that is not embedded in the cell membrane but is instead found inside the cell it is unknown if this variation affects the tslp receptor because the hla drb1 and il 7r genes are involved in the immune system changes in either might be related to the autoimmune response that damages the myelin sheath and nerve cells and leads to the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis however it is unclear exactly what role variations in either gene plays in development of the condition,multiple sclerosis,,vitamin d,Multiple Sclerosis,,Vitamin D

used surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy samarium new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials targeted therapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh of bone different types of treatment are available for children with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma mfh of bone some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment because cancer in children is rare taking part in a clinical trial should be considered some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment children with osteosarcoma or mfh should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer the

and continue for months or years are called late effects late effects of cancer treatment may include the following physical problems changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory second cancers new types of cancer some late effects may be treated or controlled it is important to talk with your child s doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child see the pdq summary on late effects of treatment for childhood cancer for more information four types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery to remove the entire tumor will be done when possible chemotherapy may be given before surgery to make the tumor smaller this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy is given so less bone tissue needs to be removed and there are fewer problems after surgery the following types of surgery may be done wide local excision surgery to remove the cancer and some healthy tissue around it limb sparing surgery removal of the tumor in a limb arm or leg without amputation so the use and appearance of the limb is saved most patients with osteosarcoma in a limb can be treated with limb sparing surgery the tumor is removed by wide local excision tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient s body or with an implant such as artificial bone if a fracture is found at diagnosis or during chemotherapy before surgery limb sparing surgery may still be possible in some cases if the surgeon is not able to remove all of the tumor and enough healthy tissue around it an amputation may be done amputation surgery to remove part or all of an arm or leg this may be done when it is not possible to remove all of the tumor in limb sparing surgery the patient may be fitted with a prosthesis artificial limb after amputation rotationplasty surgery to remove the tumor and the knee joint the part of the leg that remains below the knee is then attached to the part of the leg that remains above the knee with the foot facing backward and the ankle acting as a knee a prosthesis may then be attached to the foot studies have shown that survival is the same whether the first surgery done is a limb sparing surgery or an amputation even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery patients are also given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left in the area where the tumor was removed or that have spread to other parts of the body treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated in the treatment of osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytosis of bone chemotherapy is usually given before and after surgery to remove the primary tumor see drugs approved for bone cancer for more information radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated osteosarcoma and mfh cells are not killed easily by external radiation therapy it may be used when a small amount of cancer is left after surgery or used together with other treatments samarium samarium is a radioactive drug that targets areas where bone cells are growing such as tumor cells in bone it helps relieve pain caused by cancer in the bone and it also kills blood cells in the bone marrow it also is used to treat osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment in a different bone treatment with samarium may be followed by stem cell transplant before treatment with samarium stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored after treatment with samarium is complete the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion these reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the body s blood cells new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information

harming normal cells kinase inhibitor therapy and monoclonal antibody therapy are types of targeted therapy being studied in clinical trials for osteosarcoma kinase inhibitor therapy blocks a protein needed for cancer cells to divide sorafenib is a type of kinase inhibitor therapy being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells denosumab dinutuximab and glembatumumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten

coats plus syndrome results from mutations in the ctc1 gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in structures known as telomeres which are found at the ends of chromosomes telomeres are short repetitive segments of dna that help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down degrading in most cells telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides after a certain number of cell divisions the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self destruct undergo apoptosis the ctc1 protein works as part of a group of proteins known as the cst complex which is involved in the copying replication of telomeres the cst complex helps prevent telomeres from being degraded in some cells as the cells divide mutations in the ctc1 gene impair the function of the cst complex which affects the replication of telomeres however it is unclear how ctc1 gene mutations impact telomere structure and function some studies have found that people with ctc1 gene mutations have abnormally short telomeres while other studies have found no change in telomere length researchers are working to determine how telomeres are different in people with ctc1 gene mutations and how these changes could underlie the varied signs and symptoms of coats plus syndrome,coats plus syndrome,,,,,
ftdp 17 is caused by mutations in the mapt gene this gene is located on chromosome 17 which is how the disease got its name the mapt gene provides instructions for making a protein called tau this protein is found throughout the nervous system including in nerve cells neurons in the brain it is involved in assembling and stabilizing microtubules which are rigid hollow fibers that make up the cell s structural framework the cytoskeleton microtubules help cells maintain their shape assist in the process of cell division and are essential for the transport of materials within cells mutations in the mapt gene disrupt the normal structure and function of tau the defective protein assembles into abnormal clumps within neurons and other brain cells however it is unclear what effect these clumps have on cell function and survival ftdp 17 is characterized by the gradual death of cells in areas of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes the frontal lobes are involved in reasoning planning judgment and problem solving while the temporal lobes help process hearing speech memory and emotion a loss of cells in these brain regions leads to personality changes speech difficulties and the other features of ftdp 17 ftdp 17 is one of several related diseases known as tauopathies which are characterized by an abnormal buildup of tau in the brain,,,,,,

key points avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer the following are risk factors for breast cancer older age a personal history of breast cancer or benign noncancer breast disease inherited risk of breast cancer dense breasts exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause radiation therapy to the breast or chest obesity drinking alcohol the following are protective factors for breast cancer less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body taking estrogen only hormone therapy after hysterectomy selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators estrogen only hormone therapy after hysterectomy selective estrogen receptor modulators aromatase inhibitors and inactivators risk reducing mastectomy ovarian ablation getting enough exercise it is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer oral contraceptives environment studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer new ways to prevent breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers risk factors include smoking being overweight and not getting enough exercise increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer nci s breast cancer risk assessment tool uses a woman s risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90 this online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider for more information on breast cancer risk call 1 800 4 cancer the following are risk factors for breast cancer older age older age is the main risk factor for most cancers the chance of getting cancer increases as you get older a personal history of breast cancer or benign noncancer breast disease women with any of the following have an increased risk of breast cancer a personal history of invasive breast cancer ductal carcinoma in situ dcis or lobular carcinoma in situ lcis a personal history of benign noncancer breast disease inherited risk of breast cancer women with a family history of breast cancer in a first degree relative mother sister or daughter have an increased risk of breast cancer women who have inherited changes in the brca1 and brca2 genes or in certain other genes have a higher risk of breast cancer the risk of breast cancer caused by inherited gene changes depends on the type of gene mutation family history of cancer and other factors dense breasts having breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram is a factor in breast cancer risk the level of risk depends on how dense the breast tissue is women with very dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with low breast density increased breast density is often an inherited trait but it may also occur in women who have not had children have a first pregnancy late in life take postmenopausal hormones or drink alcohol exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body estrogen is a hormone made by the body it helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics being exposed to estrogen over a long time may increase the risk of breast cancer estrogen levels are highest during the years a woman is menstruating a woman s exposure to estrogen is increased in the following ways early menstruation beginning to have menstrual periods at age 11 or younger increases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen starting menopause at a later age the more years a woman menstruates the longer her breast tissue is exposed to estrogen older age at first birth or never having given birth because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy breast tissue is exposed to more estrogen in women who become pregnant for the first time after age 35 or who never become pregnant taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause hormones such as estrogen and progesterone can be made into a pill form in a laboratory estrogen progestin or both may be given to replace the estrogen no longer made by the ovaries in postmenopausal women or women who have had their ovaries removed this is called hormone replacement therapy hrt or hormone therapy ht combination hrt ht is estrogen combined with progestin this type of hrt ht increases the risk of breast cancer studies show that when women stop taking estrogen combined with progestin the risk of breast cancer decreases radiation therapy to the breast or chest radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of cancer increases the risk of breast cancer starting 10 years after treatment the risk of breast cancer depends on the dose of radiation and the age at which it is given the risk is highest if radiation treatment was used during puberty when breasts are forming radiation therapy to treat cancer in one breast does not appear to increase the risk of cancer in the other breast for women who have inherited changes in the brca1 and brca2 genes exposure to radiation such as that from chest x rays may further increase the risk of breast cancer especially in women who were x rayed before 20 years of age obesity obesity increases the risk of breast cancer especially in postmenopausal women who have not used hormone replacement therapy drinking alcohol drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer the level of risk rises as the amount of alcohol consumed rises the following are protective factors for breast cancer less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body decreasing the length of time a woman s breast tissue is exposed to estrogen may help prevent breast cancer exposure to estrogen is reduced in the following ways early pregnancy estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy women who have a full term pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have not had children or who give birth to their first child after age 35 breast feeding estrogen levels may remain lower while a woman is breast feeding women who breastfed have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have had children but did not breastfeed taking estrogen only hormone therapy after hysterectomy selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators estrogen only hormone therapy after hysterectomy hormone therapy with estrogen only may be given to women who have had a hysterectomy in these women estrogen only therapy after menopause may decrease the risk of breast cancer there is an increased risk of stroke and heart and blood vessel disease in postmenopausal women who take estrogen after a hysterectomy selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to the family of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators serms serms act like estrogen on some tissues in the body but block the effect of estrogen on other tissues treatment with tamoxifen lowers the risk of estrogen receptor positive er positive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ in premenopausal and postmenopausal women at high risk treatment with raloxifene also lowers the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with either drug the reduced risk lasts for several years or longer after treatment is stopped lower rates of broken bones have been noted in patients taking raloxifene taking tamoxifen increases the risk of hot flashes endometrial cancer stroke cataracts and blood clots especially in the lungs and legs the risk of having these problems increases markedly in women older than 50 years compared with younger women women younger than 50 years who have a high risk of breast cancer may benefit the most from taking tamoxifen the risk of having these problems decreases after tamoxifen is stopped talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug taking raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots in the lungs and legs but does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis decreased bone density raloxifene lowers the risk of breast cancer for women who have a high or low risk of breast cancer it is not known if raloxifene would have the same effect in women who do not have osteoporosis talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug other serms are being studied in clinical trials aromatase inhibitors and inactivators aromatase inhibitors anastrozole letrozole and inactivators exemestane lower the risk of recurrence and of new breast cancers in women who have a history of breast cancer aromatase inhibitors also decrease the risk of breast cancer in women with the following conditions postmenopausal women with a personal history of breast cancer women with no personal history of breast cancer who are 60 years and older have a history of ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy or have a high risk of breast cancer based on the gail model tool a tool used to estimate the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body before menopause estrogen is made by the ovaries and other tissues in a woman s body including the brain fat tissue and skin after menopause the ovaries stop making estrogen but the other tissues do not aromatase inhibitors block the action of an enzyme called aromatase which is used to make all of the body s estrogen aromatase inactivators stop the enzyme from working possible harms from taking aromatase inhibitors include muscle and joint pain osteoporosis hot flashes and feeling very tired risk reducing mastectomy some women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a risk reducing mastectomy the removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer the risk of breast cancer is much lower in these women and most feel less anxious about their risk of breast cancer however it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling about the different ways to prevent breast cancer before making this decision ovarian ablation the ovaries make most of the estrogen that is made by the body treatments that stop or lower the amount of estrogen made by the ovaries include surgery to remove the ovaries radiation therapy or taking certain drugs this is called ovarian ablation premenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancer due to certain changes in the brca1 and brca2 genes may choose to have a risk reducing oophorectomy the removal of both ovaries when there are no signs of cancer this decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body and lowers the risk of breast cancer risk reducing oophorectomy also lowers the risk of breast cancer in normal premenopausal women and in women with an increased risk of breast cancer due to radiation to the chest however it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling before making this decision the sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin these include hot flashes trouble sleeping anxiety and depression long term effects include decreased sex drive vaginal dryness and decreased bone density getting enough exercise women who exercise four or more hours a week have a lower risk of breast cancer the effect of exercise on breast cancer risk may be greatest in premenopausal women who have normal or low body weight it is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer oral contraceptives certain oral contraceptives contain estrogen some studies have shown that taking oral contraceptives the pill may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users this risk decreases over time other studies have not shown an increased risk of breast cancer in women who take oral contraceptives progestin only contraceptives that are injected or implanted do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer more studies are needed to know whether progestin only oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer environment studies have not proven that being exposed to certain substances in the environment such as chemicals increases the risk of breast cancer studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer the following do not affect the risk of breast cancer having an abortion making diet changes such as eating less fat or more fruits and vegetables taking vitamins including fenretinide a type of vitamin a cigarette

in its early stages adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose a health care provider may suspect it after reviewing a persons medical history and symptoms a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests a health care provider uses these tests first to determine whether cortisol levels are too low and then to establish the cause imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause a lab technician performs the following tests in a health care providers office a commercial facility or a hospital hormonal blood and urine tests acth stimulation test the acth stimulation test is the most commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in this test the patient is given an intravenous iv injection of synthetic acth and samples of blood urine or both are taken before and after the injection the cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab the normal response after an acth injection is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels people with addisons disease or longstanding secondary adrenal insufficiency have little or no increase in cortisol levels both low and high dose acth stimulation tests may be used depending on the suspected cause of adrenal insufficiency for example if secondary adrenal insufficiency is mild or has only recently occurred the adrenal glands may still respond to acth because they have not yet shut down their own production of hormone some studies have suggested a low dose1 microgram mcg may be more effective in detecting secondary adrenal insufficiency because the low dose is still enough to raise cortisol levels in healthy people yet not in people with mild or recent secondary adrenal insufficiency however recent research has shown that a significant proportion of healthy children and adults can fail the low dose test which may lead to unnecessary treatment therefore some health care providers favor using a 250 mcg acth test for more accurate results crh stimulation test when the response to the acth test is abnormal a crh stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency in this test the patient is given an iv injection of synthetic crh and blood is taken before and 30 60 90 and 120 minutes after the injection the cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab people with addisons disease respond by producing high levels of acth yet no cortisol people with secondary adrenal insufficiency do not produce acth or have a delayed response crh will not stimulate acth secretion if the pituitary is damaged so no acth response points to the pituitary as the cause a delayed acth response points to the hypothalamus as the cause diagnosis during adrenal crisis although a reliable diagnosis is not possible during adrenal crisis measurement of blood acth and cortisol during the crisisbefore treatment with corticosteroids is givenis often enough to make a preliminary diagnosis low blood sodium low blood glucose and high blood potassium are also sometimes present at the time of adrenal crisis once the crisis is controlled an acth stimulation test can be performed to help make a specific diagnosis more complex lab tests are sometimes used if the diagnosis remains unclear,secondary adrenal insufficiency,,,Secondary adrenal insufficiency,,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer five types of standard treatment are used surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy hormone therapy targeted therapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment five types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery removing the cancer in an operation is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer the following surgical procedures may be used total hysterectomy surgery to remove the uterus including the cervix if the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision cut in the abdomen the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision cut in the abdomen using a laparoscope the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy bilateral salpingo oophorectomy surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes radical hysterectomy surgery to remove the uterus cervix and part of the vagina the ovaries fallopian tubes or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed lymph node dissection a surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated hormone therapy hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach receptors drugs surgery or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells monoclonal antibodies mtor inhibitors and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells bevacizumab is used to treat stage iii stage iv and recurrent endometrial cancer mtor inhibitors block a protein called mtor which helps control cell division mtor inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage iii stage iv and recurrent endometrial cancer signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell blocking these signals may kill cancer cells metformin is being studied to treat stage iii stage iv and recurrent endometrial cancer new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials information about clinical trials is available from the nci website patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options by stage stage i and stage ii endometrial cancer low risk endometrial cancer grade 1 or grade 2 treatment of low risk stage i endometrial cancer and stage ii endometrial cancer may include the following surgery total hysterectomy

in most cases the genetic cause of progressive supranuclear palsy is unknown rarely the disease results from mutations in the mapt gene certain normal variations polymorphisms in the mapt gene have also been associated with an increased risk of developing progressive supranuclear palsy the mapt gene provides instructions for making a protein called tau this protein is found throughout the nervous system including in nerve cells neurons in the brain it is involved in assembling and stabilizing microtubules which are rigid hollow fibers that make up the cell s structural framework the cytoskeleton microtubules help cells maintain their shape assist in the process of cell division and are essential for the transport of materials within cells the signs and symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy appear to be related to abnormalities in the tau protein in people with mapt gene mutations genetic changes disrupt the protein s normal structure and function however abnormal tau is also found in affected individuals without mapt gene mutations the defective tau protein assembles into abnormal clumps within neurons and other brain cells although it is unclear what effect these clumps have on cell function and survival progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by the gradual death of brain cells particularly in structures deep within the brain that are essential for coordinating movement this loss of brain cells underlies the movement abnormalities and other features of progressive supranuclear palsy this condition is one of several related diseases known as tauopathies which are characterized by an abnormal buildup of tau in the brain researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors also contribute to progressive supranuclear palsy for example the disease has been linked to genetic changes on chromosome 1 and chromosome 11 however the specific genes involved have not been identified,progressive supranuclear palsy,,,Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,,
how might lymphatic filariasis be treated the main treatment for this disorder is the use of major anti parasiticide drugs examples of these include ivermectin albendazole and diethylcarbamazine dec these drugs work to get rid of the larval worm to inhibit reproduction of the adult worm or to kill the adult worm for individuals who are actively infected with the filarial parasite dec is typically the drug of choice in the united states the drug kills the microfilaria and some of the adult worms dec has been used world wide for more than 50 years because this infection is rare in the u s the drug is no longer approved by the food and drug administration fda and cannot be sold in the united states physicians can typically obtain the medication from the cdc after confirmed positive lab results dec is generally well tolerated side effects are in general limited and depend on the number of microfilariae in the blood the most common side effects are dizziness nausea fever headache or pain in muscles or joints another treatment option ivermectin kills only the microfilariae for individuals with clinical symptoms of the condition treatment depends on the signs and symptoms the affected individual has lymphedema and elephantiasis are not typically indications for dec treatment because most people with lymphedema are not actively infected with the filarial parasite to prevent the lymphedema from getting worse individuals should ask their physician for a referral to a lymphedema therapist so they can be informed about some basic principles of care such as hygiene exercise and treatment of wounds men with hydrocele abnormal accumulation of fluid in the scrotum may have evidence of active infection but typically do not improve clinically following treatment with dec the treatment for hydrocele is surgery surgery may also be performed to remove the remains of adult worms and calcifications developing around them treatment of elephantiasis of the legs usually consists of elevation and support from elastic stockings in the tropical areas of the world mosquito control is an important part of prevention of filariasis filariasis is usually a self limited disease unless reinfection occurs therefore some cases especially those brought into temperate regions of the world i e north america may be left untreated because there is no danger of spreading the disease,"lymphatic filariasis, fever, headache, pain, lymphedema, filariasis",surgery,,"Fever, Lymphedema, Headache, Pain, Lymphatic filariasis",Surgery,

cbf aml is associated with chromosomal rearrangements between chromosomes 8 and 21 and within chromosome 16 the rearrangements involve the runx1 runx1t1 cbfb and myh11 genes two of these genes runx1 and cbfb provide instructions for making the two pieces of a protein complex known as core binding factor cbf cbf attaches to certain regions of dna and turns on genes that help control the development of blood cells hematopoiesis in particular it plays an important role in development of hematopoietic stem cells chromosomal rearrangements involving the runx1 or cbfb gene alter cbf leading to leukemia in cbf aml the runx1 gene is affected by a type of genetic rearrangement known as a translocation in this type of change pieces of dna from two chromosomes break off and are interchanged the most common translocation in this condition called t 8 21 fuses a part of the runx1 gene on chromosome 21 with part of the runx1t1 gene also known as eto on chromosome 8 the combination of these genes leads to production of the runx1 eto fusion protein this fusion protein is able to form cbf and attach to dna like the normal runx1 protein however because the function of the protein produced from the normal runx1t1 gene is to block gene activity the abnormal cbf turns genes off instead of turning them on other genetic rearrangements associated with cbf aml alter the cbfb gene one such rearrangement called an inversion involves breakage of a chromosome in two places the resulting piece of dna is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome the inversion involved in cbf aml written as inv 16 leads to the fusion of two genes on chromosome 16 cbfb and myh11 less commonly a translocation involving chromosome 16 written as t 16 16 leads to the fusion of the same two genes the protein produced from these genetic rearrangements is called cbf myh11 the fusion protein can form cbf but it is thought that the presence of the myh11 portion of the fusion protein prevents cbf from binding to dna impairing its ability to control gene activity alternatively the myh11 portion may interact with other proteins that prevent cbf from controlling gene activity the change in gene activity caused by alteration of cbf blocks the maturation differentiation of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal myeloid blasts however a chromosomal rearrangement alone is usually not enough to cause leukemia one or more additional genetic changes are needed for cancer to develop the additional changes likely cause the immature cells to grow and divide uncontrollably leading to the excess of myeloid blasts characteristic of cbf aml,"leukemia, cancer",stem cells,,"Leukemia, Cancer",Stem Cells,
how might acquired pure red cell aplasia be treated the main goals of treatment for pure red cell aplasia prca are to restore the production of red blood cells maintain adequate hemoglobin levels and treat underlying disorders that may be causing the condition the initial treatment plan typically includes blood transfusions for individuals who are severely anemic and have cardiorespiratory failure prca due to medication or infections is usually reversible within a few months therefore medications that may be causing the condition should be discontinued and infections that may cause the condition should be treated underlying conditions that may cause prca such as a thymoma hematological cancers solid tumors and systemic lupus erythematosus sle should be treated as necessary as well when the condition is idiopathic of unknown cause or due to an autoimmune disorder prca is typically initially treated with corticosteroids it has been reported that individuals who seem to be resistant to treatment may respond to a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin ivig while others have responded to a single dose in the united states financial issues may make it difficult to obtain this treatment because ivig is expensive and is not approved by the food and drug administration to treat prca additional and more detailed information about the management of acquired prca may be found on emedicine s web site and can be viewed by clicking here,lupus,,,"Lupus, Acquired pure red cell aplasia",,

other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes genetic mutations affecting beta cells insulin and insulin action some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations or changes in a single gene these mutations are usually inherited but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin the most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus ndm and mody ndm occurs in the first 6 months of life mody is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life more information about ndm and mody is provided in the niddk health topic monogenic forms of diabetes other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors other genetic diseases diabetes occurs in people with down syndrome klinefelter syndrome and turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes the genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus which blocks the pancreas the risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron if the disorder is not treated iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs damage to or removal of the pancreas pancreatitis cancer and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production thus causing diabetes if the damaged pancreas is removed diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells endocrine diseases endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone glucagonoma a rare tumor of the pancreas can also cause diabetes the tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon hyperthyroidism a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone can also cause elevated blood glucose levels autoimmune disorders rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes this kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells similar to type 1 diabetes medications and chemical toxins some medications such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics anti seizure drugs psychiatric drugs and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action pentamidine a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia can increase the risk of pancreatitis beta cell damage and diabetes also glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis asthma lupus and ulcerative colitis many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans for example dioxina contaminant of the herbicide agent orange used during the vietnam warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes in 2000 based on a report from the institute of medicine the u s department of veterans affairs va added diabetes to the list of conditions for which vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation also a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes lipodystrophy lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body the condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes,"diabetes, down syndrome, klinefelter syndrome, turner syndrome, genetic disorders, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, pancreatitis, cancer, endocrine diseases, acromegaly, prediabetes, stress, hyperthyroidism, lupus, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, ulcerative colitis",,,"Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ulcerative Colitis, Pneumonia, Genetic Disorders, Arthritis, Endocrine Diseases, Asthma, Turner Syndrome, Prediabetes, Hemochromatosis, Down Syndrome, Cancer, Stress, Cystic Fibrosis, Lupus, Hyperthyroidism, Pancreatitis, Acromegaly, Klinefelter syndrome",,
deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder that can cause liver disease and neurological problems researchers have described two forms of this disorder the majority of affected individuals have the more severe form which is called hepatocerebral because of the serious problems it causes in the liver and brain newborns with the hepatocerebral form of deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency may have a buildup of lactic acid in the body lactic acidosis within the first few days after birth they may also have weakness behavior changes such as poor feeding and decreased activity and vomiting affected newborns sometimes have low blood sugar hypoglycemia as a result of liver dysfunction during the first few weeks of life they begin showing other signs of liver disease which may result in liver failure they also develop progressive neurological problems including very weak muscle tone severe hypotonia abnormal eye movements nystagmus and the loss of skills they had previously acquired developmental regression children with this form of the disorder usually do not survive past the age of 2 years some individuals with deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency have a milder form of the disorder without severe neurological problems liver disease is the primary symptom of this form of the disorder generally becoming evident during infancy or childhood occasionally it first appears after an illness such as a viral infection affected individuals may also develop kidney problems mild hypotonia is the only neurological effect associated with this form of the disorder,hypoglycemia,,,Hypoglycemia,,

prader willi syndrome is caused by the loss of function of genes in a particular region of chromosome 15 people normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent some genes are turned on active only on the copy that is inherited from a person s father the paternal copy this parent specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting most cases of prader willi syndrome about 70 percent occur when a segment of the paternal chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell people with this chromosomal change are missing certain critical genes in this region because the genes on the paternal copy have been deleted and the genes on the maternal copy are turned off inactive in another 25 percent of cases a person with prader willi syndrome has two copies of chromosome 15 inherited from his or her mother maternal copies instead of one copy from each parent this phenomenon is called maternal uniparental disomy rarely prader willi syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation or by a mutation or other defect that abnormally turns off inactivates genes on the paternal chromosome 15 it appears likely that the characteristic features of prader willi syndrome result from the loss of function of several genes on chromosome 15 among these are genes that provide instructions for making molecules called small nucleolar rnas snornas these molecules have a variety of functions including helping to regulate other types of rna molecules rna molecules play essential roles in producing proteins and in other cell activities studies suggest that the loss of a particular group of snorna genes known as the snord116 cluster may play a major role in causing the signs and symptoms of prader willi syndrome however it is unknown how a missing snord116 cluster could contribute to intellectual disability behavioral problems and the physical features of the disorder in some people with prader willi syndrome the loss of a gene called oca2 is associated with unusually fair skin and light colored hair the oca2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder however loss of the oca2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of prader willi syndrome the protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring pigmentation of the skin hair and eyes researchers are studying other genes on chromosome 15 that may also be related to the major signs and symptoms of this condition,,,,Prader-Willi Syndrome,,

the urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water the urinary tract includes two kidneys two ureters a bladder and a urethra the kidneys are two bean shaped organs each about the size of a fist they are located near the middle of the back just below the rib cage one on each side of the spine every day the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine composed of wastes and extra water the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters the bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination when the bladder empties urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder,,,,,,
mutations in the nf2 gene cause neurofibromatosis type 2 the nf2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called merlin also known as schwannomin this protein is produced in the nervous system particularly in schwann cells which surround and insulate nerve cells neurons in the brain and spinal cord merlin acts as a tumor suppressor which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way although its exact function is unknown this protein is likely also involved in controlling cell movement cell shape and communication between cells mutations in the nf2 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the merlin protein that cannot regulate the growth and division of cells research suggests that the loss of merlin allows cells especially schwann cells to multiply too frequently and form the tumors characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2,neurofibromatosis type 2,,,Neurofibromatosis,,

fragile x associated primary ovarian insufficiency fxpoi is a condition that affects women and is characterized by reduced function of the ovaries the ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced as a form of primary ovarian insufficiency fxpoi can cause irregular menstrual cycles early menopause an inability to have children infertility and elevated levels of a hormone known as follicle stimulating hormone fsh fsh is produced in both males and females and helps regulate the development of reproductive cells eggs in females and sperm in males in females the level of fsh rises and falls but overall it increases as a woman ages in younger women elevated levels may indicate early menopause and fertility problems the severity of fxpoi is variable the most severely affected women have overt poi formerly called premature ovarian failure these women have irregular or absent menstrual periods and elevated fsh levels before age 40 overt poi often causes infertility other women have occult poi they have normal menstrual periods but reduced fertility and they may have elevated levels of fsh in which case it is called biochemical poi the reduction in ovarian function caused by fxpoi results in low levels of the hormone estrogen which leads to many of the common signs and symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes insomnia and thinning of the bones osteoporosis women with fxpoi undergo menopause an average of 5 years earlier than women without the condition,"menopause, infertility, falls, premature ovarian failure, insomnia, osteoporosis",,,"Osteoporosis, Premature Ovarian Failure, Menopause, Falls, Infertility, Insomnia",,
hereditary xanthinuria type i is caused by mutations in the xdh gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called xanthine dehydrogenase this enzyme is involved in the normal breakdown of purines which are building blocks of dna and its chemical cousin rna specifically xanthine dehydrogenase carries out the final two steps in the process including the conversion of xanthine to uric acid which is excreted in urine and feces mutations in the xdh gene reduce or eliminate the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase as a result the enzyme is not available to help carry out the last two steps of purine breakdown because xanthine is not converted to uric acid affected individuals have high levels of xanthine and very low levels of uric acid in their blood and urine the excess xanthine can cause damage to the kidneys and other tissues hereditary xanthinuria type ii results from mutations in the mocos gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called molybdenum cofactor sulfurase this enzyme is necessary for the normal function of xanthine dehydrogenase described above and another enzyme called aldehyde oxidase mutations in the mocos gene prevent xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase from being turned on activated the loss of xanthine dehydrogenase activity prevents the conversion of xanthine to uric acid leading to an accumulation of xanthine in the kidneys and other tissues the loss of aldehyde oxidase activity does not appear to cause any health problems,hereditary xanthinuria type i,,,,,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with laryngeal cancer three types of standard treatment are used radiation therapy surgery chemotherapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials chemoprevention radiosensitizers patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with laryngeal cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with laryngeal cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment three types of standard treatment are used radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment external radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works the doctor may test the thyroid gland before and after therapy to make sure it is working properly hyperfractionated radiation therapy and new types of radiation therapy are being studied in the treatment of laryngeal cancer surgery surgery removing the cancer in an operation is a common treatment for all stages of laryngeal cancer the following surgical procedures may be used cordectomy surgery to remove the vocal cords only supraglottic laryngectomy surgery to remove the supraglottis only hemilaryngectomy surgery to remove half of the larynx voice box a hemilaryngectomy saves the voice partial laryngectomy surgery to remove part of the larynx voice box a partial laryngectomy helps keep the patient s ability to talk total laryngectomy surgery to remove the whole larynx during this operation a hole is made in the front of the neck to allow the patient to breathe this is called a tracheostomy thyroidectomy the removal of all or part of the thyroid gland laser surgery a surgical procedure that uses a laser beam a narrow beam of intense light as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for head and neck cancer for more information laryngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci web site chemoprevention chemoprevention is the use of drugs vitamins or other substances to reduce the risk of developing cancer or to reduce the risk cancer will recur come back the drug isotretinoin is being studied to prevent the development of a second cancer in patients who have had cancer of the head or neck radiosensitizers radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come

the first treatment step is to bring blood glucose levels within the normal range to help prevent further nerve damage blood glucose monitoring meal planning physical activity and diabetes medicines or insulin will help control blood glucose levels symptoms may get worse when blood glucose is first brought under control but over time maintaining lower blood glucose levels helps lessen symptoms good blood glucose control may also help prevent or delay the onset of further problems as scientists learn more about the underlying causes of neuropathy new treatments may become available to help slow prevent or even reverse nerve damage as described in the following sections additional treatment depends on the type of nerve problem and symptom pain relief doctors usually treat painful diabetic neuropathy with oral medications although other types of treatments may help some people people with severe nerve pain may benefit from a combination of medications or treatments and should consider talking with a health care provider about treatment options medications used to help relieve diabetic nerve pain include tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline imipramine and desipramine norpramin pertofrane other types of antidepressants such as duloxetine cymbalta venlafaxine bupropion wellbutrin paroxetine paxil and citalopram celexa anticonvulsants such as pregabalin lyrica gabapentin gabarone neurontin carbamazepine and lamotrigine lamictal opioids and opioidlike drugs such as controlled release oxycodone an opioid and tramadol ultram an opioid that also acts as an antidepressant duloxetine and pregabalin are approved by the u s food and drug administration specifically for treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy people do not have to be depressed for an antidepressant to help relieve their nerve pain all medications have side effects and some are not recommended for use in older adults or those with heart disease because over the counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may not work well for treating most nerve pain and can have serious side effects some experts recommend avoiding these medications treatments that are applied to the skintypically to the feetinclude capsaicin cream and lidocaine patches lidoderm lidopain studies suggest that nitrate sprays or patches for the feet may relieve pain studies of alpha lipoic acid an antioxidant and evening primrose oil suggest they may help relieve symptoms and improve nerve function in some patients a device called a bed cradle can keep sheets and blankets from

a urinary tract infection the doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection people who have incontinence should try to urinate at regular intervalsevery 3 hours for examplebecause they may not be able to tell when the bladder is full to treat erectile dysfunction in men the doctor will first do tests to rule out a hormonal cause several methods are available to treat erectile dysfunction caused by neuropathy medicines are available to help men have and maintain erections by increasing blood flow to the penis some are oral medications and others are injected into the penis or inserted into the urethra at the tip of the penis mechanical vacuum devices can also increase blood flow to the penis another option is to surgically implant

comprehensive foot care programs can reduce amputation rates by 45 to 85 percent careful foot care involves cleaning the feet daily using warmnot hotwater and a mild soap soaking the feet should be avoided a soft towel can be used to dry the feet and between the toes inspecting the feet and toes every day for cuts blisters redness swelling calluses or other problems using a mirrorhandheld or placed on the floormay be helpful in checking the bottoms of the feet or another person can help check the feet a health care provider should be notified of any problems using lotion to moisturize the feet getting lotion between the toes should be avoided filing corns and calluses gently with a pumice stone after a bath or shower cutting toenails to the shape of the toes and filing the edges with an emery board each week or when needed always wearing shoes or slippers to protect feet from injuries wearing thick soft seamless socks can prevent skin irritation wearing shoes that fit well and allow the toes to move new shoes can be broken in gradually by first wearing them for only an hour at a time looking shoes over carefully before putting them on and feeling the insides to make sure

mutations in the arg1 gene cause arginase deficiency arginase deficiency belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders the urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells this cycle processes excess nitrogen generated when protein is used by the body to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys the arg1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arginase this enzyme controls the final step of the urea cycle which produces urea by removing nitrogen from arginine in people with arginase deficiency arginase is damaged or missing and arginine is not broken down properly as a result urea cannot be produced normally and excess nitrogen accumulates in the blood in the form of ammonia the accumulation of ammonia and arginine are believed to cause the neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of arginase deficiency,"arginase deficiency, urea cycle disorders",,,"Arginase deficiency, Urea cycle disorders",,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with rectal cancer five types of standard treatment are used surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy active surveillance targeted therapy other types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with rectal cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with rectal cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment five types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery is the most common treatment for all stages of rectal cancer the cancer is removed using one of the following types of surgery polypectomy if the cancer is found in a polyp a small piece of bulging tissue the polyp is often removed during a colonoscopy local excision if the cancer is found on the inside surface of the rectum and has not spread into the wall of the rectum the cancer and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue is removed resection if the cancer has spread into the wall of the rectum the section of the rectum with cancer and nearby healthy tissue is removed sometimes the tissue between the rectum and the abdominal wall is also removed the lymph nodes near the rectum are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer radiofrequency ablation the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed in other cases the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen this is done in the hospital with general anesthesia cryosurgery a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue this type of treatment is also called cryotherapy pelvic exenteration if the cancer has spread to other organs near the rectum the lower colon rectum and bladder are removed in women the cervix vagina ovaries and nearby lymph nodes may be removed in men the prostate may be removed artificial openings stoma are made for urine and stool to flow from the body to a collection bag after the cancer is removed the surgeon will either do an anastomosis sew the healthy parts of the rectum together sew the remaining rectum to the colon or sew the colon to the anus or make a stoma an opening from the rectum to the outside of the body for waste to pass through this procedure is done if the cancer is too close to the anus and is called a colostomy a bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the rectum has healed and then it can be reversed if the entire rectum is removed however the colostomy may be permanent radiation therapy and or chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor make it easier to remove the cancer and help with bowel control after surgery treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy even if all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation is removed some patients may be given radiation therapy and or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external radiation therapy is used to treat rectal cancer short course preoperative radiation therapy is used in some types of rectal cancer this treatment uses fewer and lower doses of radiation than standard treatment followed by surgery several days after the last dose chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy chemoembolization of the hepatic artery is a type of regional chemotherapy that may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver this is done by blocking the hepatic artery the main artery that supplies blood to the liver and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver the livers arteries then carry the drugs into the liver only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body the blockage may be temporary or permanent depending on what is used to block the artery the liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein which carries blood from the stomach and intestine the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated see drugs approved for rectal cancer for more information active surveillance active surveillance is closely following a patient s condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results it is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse in active surveillance patients are given certain exams and tests to check if the cancer is growing when the cancer begins to grow treatment is given to cure the cancer tests include the following digital rectal exam mri endoscopy sigmoidoscopy ct scan carcinoembryonic antigen cea assay targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of rectal cancer include the following monoclonal antibodies monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy being used for the treatment of rectal cancer monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion they may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor vegf this may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor egfr on the surface of some types of cancer cells this may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing angiogenesis inhibitors angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow ziv aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment it blocks the action of certain proteins including vascular endothelial growth factor this may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them it may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow see drugs approved for rectal cancer for more information other types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials information about clinical trials is available from the nci website patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or

blood pressure medicines scientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly two types of drugs angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure in addition to an ace inhibitor or an arb a diuretic can also be useful beta blockers calcium channel blockers and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed an example of an effective ace inhibitor is lisinopril prinivil zestril which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes the benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure it may directly protect the kidneys glomeruli ace inhibitors have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure an example of an effective arb is losartan cozaar which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events patients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines moderate protein diets in people with diabetes excessive consumption of protein may be harmful experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein but avoid high protein diets for people with greatly reduced kidney function a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure anyone following a reduced protein diet should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition intensive management of blood glucose antihypertensive drugs and low protein diets can slow ckd a third treatment known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control has shown great promise for people with diabetes especially for those in the early stages of ckd the human body normally converts food to glucose the simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the body s cells to enter cells glucose needs the help of insulin a hormone produced by the pancreas when a person does not make enough insulin or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present the body cannot process glucose and it builds up in the bloodstream high levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes intensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal the regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity following a diet and activity plan and consulting a health care team regularly some people use an insulin pump to supply insulin throughout the day a number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose in the diabetes control and complications trial supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk researchers found a 50 percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels the intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of 150 milligrams per deciliterabout 80 milligrams per deciliter lower than the levels observed in the conventionally managed patients the united kingdom prospective diabetes study conducted from 1976 to 1997 showed conclusively that in people with improved blood glucose control the risk of early kidney disease was reduced by a third additional studies conducted over the past decades have clearly established that any program resulting in sustained lowering of blood glucose levels will be beneficial to patients in the early stages of ckd,"kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney failure, kidney diseases",,,"High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Kidney Disease, Kidney Failure, Kidney Diseases",,Blood Pressure Medicines

mutations in the nlrp3 and nlrp12 genes cause familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome the nlrp3 gene also known as cias1 provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin and the nlrp12 gene provides instructions for making the protein monarch 1 cryopyrin and monarch 1 belong to a family of proteins called nucleotide binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing nlr proteins these proteins are involved in the immune system helping to regulate the process of inflammation inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair when this has been accomplished the body stops inhibits the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues cryopyrin is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome which helps start the inflammatory process mutations in the nlrp3 gene result in a hyperactive cryopyrin protein that inappropriately triggers an inflammatory response monarch 1 is involved in the inhibition of the inflammatory response mutations in the nlrp12 gene appear to reduce the ability of the monarch 1 protein to inhibit inflammation impairment of the body s mechanisms for controlling inflammation results in the episodes of skin rash fever and joint pain seen in familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome it is unclear why episodes are triggered by cold exposure in this disorder,"familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, fever, pain",,,"Fever, Pain",,

your doctor will diagnosecoronary heart disease chd based on your medical and family histories your risk factors a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures no single test can diagnose chd if your doctor thinks you have chd he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests ekg electrocardiogram an ekgis a simple painless test that detects and records the heart s electrical activity the test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm steady or irregular an ekg also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart an ekg can show signs of heart damage due to chd and signs of a previous or current heart attack stress testing duringstress testing you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done if you can t exercise you may be given medicines to increase your heart rate when your heart is working hard and beating fast it needs more blood and oxygen plaque narrowed coronary heart arteries can t supply enough oxygen rich blood to meet your heart s needs a stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of chd such as abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure shortness of breath or chest pain abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart s electrical activity if you can t exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age your heart may not be getting enough oxygen rich blood however other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough for example lung diseases anemia or poor general fitness as part of some stress tests pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest these imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats echocardiography echocardiography echo uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart the test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart areas of heart muscle that aren t contracting normally and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow chest x ray achest x raycreates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest such as your heart lungs and blood vessels a chest x ray can reveal signs ofheart failure as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to chd blood tests blood tests check the levels of certain fats cholesterol sugar and proteins in your blood abnormal levels may be a sign that you re at risk for chd blood tests also help detectanemia a risk factor for chd during a heart attack heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream high levels of these proteins are a sign of a recent heart attack coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization your doctor may recommendcoronary angiography an jee og rah fee if other tests or factors suggest you have chd this test uses dye and special x rays to look inside your coronary arteries to get the dye into your coronary arteries your doctor will use a procedure calledcardiac catheterization kath eh ter ih za shun a thin flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm groin upper thigh or neck the tube is threaded into your coronary arteries and the dye is released into your bloodstream special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries the dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels coronary angiography detects blockages in the large coronary arteries however the test doesn t detectcoronary microvascular disease mvd this is because coronary mvd doesn t cause blockages in the large coronary arteries even if the results of your coronary angiography are normal you may still have chest pain or other chd symptoms if so talk with your doctor about whether you might have coronary mvd your doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire called the duke activity status index this questionnaire measures how easily you can do routine tasks it gives your doctor information about how well blood is flowing through your coronary arteries your doctor also may recommend other tests that measure blood flow in the heart such as acardiac mri magnetic resonance imaging stress test cardiac mri uses radio waves magnets and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it beats the test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels other tests done during cardiac catheterization can check blood flow in the heart s small arteries and the thickness of the artery walls tests used to diagnose

kidney disease can get worse over time and may lead to kidney failure kidney failure means advanced kidney damage with less than 15 normal function most people with kidney failure have symptoms from the build up of waste products and extra water in their body end stage renal disease esrd is kidney failure treated by dialysis or kidney transplant if kidney disease progresses to kidney failure the goal of treatment changes since the kidneys no longer work well enough to maintain health it is necessary to choose a treatment in order to maintain health there are two main options for this dialysis and transplantation some patients choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant instead they receive supportive care to treat their symptoms before you and your health care team decide on a treatment plan it is important that you understand how each treatment option is likely to affect how long you will live or how good you will feel if your kidney disease is progressing talk with your health care provider about choosing a treatment that is right for you watch the video to learn more about dialysis decisions to enlarge the videos on this page click the brackets in the lower right hand corner of the video screen to reduce the videos press the escape esc button on your keyboard two kinds of dialysis dialysis is a treatment that takes waste products and extra fluid out of your body in hemodialysis your blood passes through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to your body in hemodialysis blood is run through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to the body hemodialysis is usually done at a dialysis center three times a week but it can also be done at home each session usually lasts between three and four hours peritoneal dialysis is another way to remove wastes from your blood this kind of dialysis uses the lining of your abdominal cavity the space in your body that holds organs like the stomach intestines and liver to filter your blood it works by putting a special fluid into your abdomen that absorbs waste products in your blood as it passes through small blood vessels in this lining this fluid with the waste products is then drained away a key benefit of peritoneal dialysis is that it can be done at home while you sleep hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis do not cure kidney failure they are treatments that help replace the function of the kidneys and may help you feel better and live longer but for some people who have many health problems and are age 75 or older studies show that treatment with dialysis may not help if you are on dialysis although patients with kidney failure are now living longer than ever over the years kidney disease can cause problems such as depression heart disease bone disease arthritis nerve damage malnutrition depression heart disease bone disease arthritis nerve damage malnutrition to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible while on dialysis follow your dietitian s advice take your medicines and follow healthy lifestyle and diet habits to keep a healthy weight and control blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol follow your dietitian s advice take your medicines and follow healthy lifestyle and diet habits to keep a healthy weight and control blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol dialysis can be a special challenge for older adults especially those who have other diseases or conditions for example for hemodialysis a person must be able to leave home travel to the dialysis facility and sit for 4 hours during treatment peritoneal dialysis can be done at home but someone needs to help often older adults need help with some or all of these activities they and their families need to think about these issues as they choose treatment options and living facilities learn more about dialysis eating diet and nutrition on dialysis for people who are on dialysis or approaching total kidney failure adequate nutrition is important for maintaining energy strength healthy sleep patterns bone health heart health and good mental health the diet should be based on the type of treatment the person is getting people on hemodialysis must watch how much fluid they drink and avoid eating foods with too much sodium potassium and phosphorus in contrast people on peritoneal dialysisa type of dialysis that uses the lining of the abdomen or belly to filter the blood inside the bodymay be able to eat more potassium rich foods because peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body more efficiently than hemodialysis both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from the body so anyone on either form of dialysis should eat protein rich foods such as meat fish and eggs people on hemodialysis must watch how much fluid they drink and avoid eating foods with too much sodium potassium and phosphorus in contrast people on peritoneal dialysisa type of dialysis that uses the lining of the abdomen or belly to filter the blood inside the bodymay be able to eat more potassium rich foods because peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body more efficiently than hemodialysis both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from the body so anyone on either form of dialysis should eat protein rich foods such as meat fish and eggs all dialysis centers have a renal dietitian who helps people with kidney failure make healthy food choices people who are on dialysis should talk with their clinics renal dietitian the renal dietitian can help make a meal plan that will help their treatment work well kidney transplantation some people with kidney failure including older adults may be able to receive a kidney transplant this involves having a healthy kidney from another person surgically placed into your body the new donated kidney does the work the failed kidneys used to do the donated kidney can come from someone you dont know who has recently died or from a living person usually a family member but you might also be able to receive a kidney from an unrelated donor including your spouse or a friend due to the shortage of kidneys patients on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney may wait many years watch the video to learn more about kidney transplantation kidney transplantation is a treatment for kidney failure not a cure you will need to see your healthcare provider regularly and you will need to take medicines for as long as you have your transplant these medicines suppress your immune system so it doesn t reject the transplanted kidney eating diet and nutrition after a transplant after a transplant it is still important to make healthy food choices it is still important to eat foods with less salt this may help you keep a healthy blood pressure you should also choose foods that are healthy for your heart like fresh fruits fresh or frozen vegetables whole grains and low fat dairy foods if you were on dialysis before the transplant you may find that your diet after transplant is much easier to follow you can drink more fluids and eat many of the fruits and vegetables you had to eat less of while on dialysis you may even need to gain a little weight but be careful not to gain weight too quickly all transplant clinics have a renal dietitian who helps people with kidney failure make healthy food choices people who have had a transplant should talk with their clinics renal dietitian the renal dietitian can help make a meal plan that will help keep the new kidney healthy learn more about kidney transplantation choosing not to treat with dialysis or transplant you may choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant instead you may choose to focus on treating its complications if you choose this path you will still get care from your health care team your care may include medicines to protect remaining kidney function for as long as possible medicines to treat symptoms of kidney failure such as nausea anemia and poor appetite advice on diet and lifestyle choices and care to ease symptoms provide relief from physical and emotional pain and enhance quality of life medicines to protect remaining kidney function for as long as possible medicines to treat symptoms of kidney failure such as nausea anemia and poor appetite advice on diet and lifestyle choices and care to ease symptoms provide relief from physical and emotional pain and enhance quality of life you have the right to choose not to start dialysis or undergo transplant surgery you may choose not to treat with dialysis or transplant if you feel that the burdens would outweigh the benefits or you may make this choice if you feel these treatments would lower your quality of life only you know what it is like for you to live with kidney failure treatment with no dialysis or transplant may be a choice for you if you and your doctor feel dialysis or transplant will not improve your health for some people who have many health problems and are age 75 or older studies show that treatment with dialysis may not help you feel youve accomplished what you wanted in life family and friends support your decision you and your doctor feel dialysis or transplant will not improve your health for some people who have many health problems and are age 75 or older studies show that treatment with dialysis may not help you feel youve accomplished what you wanted in life family and friends support your decision choosing the right treatment not all treatments are right for all people talk to your doctor and other health professionals including nurses dietitians and diabetes educators to figure out the best treatment plan for you the right choice for you depends upon your medical condition lifestyle and personal likes and dislikes each treatment option may have a different effect on how long you live your overall health what and how much you can do how well you can get around how you feel

mutations in the fgfr3 gene have been found in approximately 30 percent of people with a type of nevus in the keratinocytic epidermal nevi group the gene mutations involved in most epidermal nevi are unknown mutations associated with an epidermal nevus are present only in the cells of the nevus not in the normal skin cells surrounding it because the mutation is found in some of the body s cells but not in others people with an epidermal nevus are said to be mosaic for the mutation the fgfr3 gene provides instructions for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 fgfr3 protein this protein is involved in several important cellular processes including regulation of growth and division of skin cells the fgfr3 protein interacts with specific growth factors outside the cell to receive signals that control growth and development when these growth factors attach to the fgfr3 protein the protein is turned on activated which triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that control growth and other cellular functions the most common fgfr3 gene mutation in epidermal nevi creates a protein that is turned on without attachment of a growth factor which means that the fgfr3 protein is constantly active cells with a mutated fgfr3 gene grow and divide more than normal cells in addition these mutated cells do not undergo a form of self destruction called apoptosis as readily as normal cells these effects result in overgrowth of skin cells leading to epidermal nevi,,,,,,

pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of related conditions that affect the development of the brain the term pontocerebellar refers to the pons and the cerebellum which are the brain structures that are most severely affected in many forms of this disorder the pons is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem where it transmits signals between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain the cerebellum which is located at the back of the brain normally coordinates movement the term hypoplasia refers to the underdevelopment of these brain regions pontocerebellar hypoplasia also causes impaired growth of other parts of the brain leading to an unusually small head size microcephaly this microcephaly is usually not apparent at birth but becomes noticeable as brain growth continues to be slow in infancy and early childhood researchers have described at least ten types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia all forms of this condition are characterized by impaired brain development delayed development overall problems with movement and intellectual disability the brain abnormalities are usually present at birth and in some cases they can be detected before birth many children with pontocerebellar hypoplasia live only into infancy or childhood although some affected individuals have lived into adulthood the two major forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are designated as type 1 pch1 and type 2 pch2 in addition to the brain abnormalities described above pch1 causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord similar to another genetic disorder known as spinal muscular atrophy individuals with pch1 also have very weak muscle tone hypotonia joint deformities called contractures vision impairment and breathing and feeding problems that are evident from early infancy common features of pch2 include a lack of voluntary motor skills such as grasping objects sitting or walking problems with swallowing dysphagia and an absence of communication including speech affected children typically develop temporary jitteriness generalized clonus in early infancy abnormal patterns of movement described as chorea or dystonia and stiffness spasticity many also have impaired vision and seizures the other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia designated as type 3 pch3 through type 10 pch10 appear to be rare and have each been reported in only a small number of individuals because the different types have overlapping features and some are caused by mutations in the same genes researchers have proposed that the types be considered as a spectrum instead of distinct conditions,"microcephaly, spinal muscular atrophy, dystonia, seizures",,,"Dystonia, Seizures, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Microcephaly",,
a health care provider treats urinary retention with bladder drainage urethral dilation urethral stents prostate medications surgery the type and length of treatment depend on the type and cause of urinary retention bladder drainage bladder drainage involves catheterization to drain urine treatment of acute urinary retention begins with catheterization to relieve the immediate distress of a full bladder and prevent bladder damage a health care provider performs catheterization during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital the patient often receives local anesthesia the health care provider can pass a catheter through the urethra into the bladder in cases of a blocked urethra he or she can pass a catheter directly through the lower abdomen just above the pubic bone directly into the bladder in these cases the health care provider will use anesthesia for chronic urinary retention the patient may require intermittentoccasional or not continuousor long term catheterization if other treatments do not work patients who need to continue intermittent catheterization will receive instruction regarding how to selfcatheterize to drain urine as necessary urethral dilation urethral dilation treats urethral stricture by inserting increasingly wider tubes into the urethra to widen the stricture an alternative dilation method involves inflating a small balloon at the end of a catheter inside the urethra a health care provider performs a urethral dilation during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital the patient will receive local anesthesia in some cases the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia urethral stents another treatment for urethral stricture involves inserting an artificial tube called a stent into the urethra to the area of the stricture once in place the stent expands like a spring and pushes back the surrounding tissue widening the urethra stents may be temporary or permanent a health care provider performs stent placement during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital the patient will receive local anesthesia in some cases the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia prostate medications medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or relieve urinary retention symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia include dutasteride

the prostate removal of the enlarged tissue usually relieves the blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia a urologist performs some procedures on an outpatient basis some men may require a hospital stay in some cases the urologist will remove the entire prostate using open surgery men will receive general anesthesia and have a longer hospital stay than for other surgical procedures men will also have a longer rehabilitation period for open surgery more information is provided in the niddk health topic prostate enlargement benign prostatic hyperplasia internal urethrotomy a urologist can repair a urethral stricture by performing an internal urethrotomy for this procedure the urologist inserts a special catheter into the urethra until it reaches the stricture the urologist then uses a knife or laser to make an incision that opens the stricture the urologist performs an internal urethrotomy in an outpatient center or a hospital the patient will receive general anesthesia cystocele or rectocele repair women may need surgery to lift a fallen bladder or rectum into its normal position the most common procedure for cystocele and rectocele repair involves a urologist who also specializes in the female reproductive system making an incision in the wall of the vagina through the incision the urologist looks for a defect or hole in the tissue that normally separates the vagina from the other pelvic organs the urologist places stitches in the tissue to close up the defect and then closes the incision in the vaginal wall with more stitches removing any extra tissue these stitches tighten the layers of tissue that separate the organs creating more support for the pelvic organs a urologist or gynecologista doctor who specializes in the female reproductive systemperforms the surgery to repair a cystocele or rectocele in a hospital women will receive anesthesia tumor and cancer surgery removal of tumors and cancerous tissues in the

key points after breast cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for breast cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ stage i stage ii stage iiia stage iiib stage iiic stage iv the treatment of breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease after breast cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body the process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the results of some of the tests used to diagnose breast cancer are also used to stage the disease see the general information section the following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process sentinel lymph node biopsy the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery the sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor it is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor a radioactive substance and or blue dye is injected near the tumor the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are not found it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes chest x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the chest an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography bone scan a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if breast cancer spreads to the bone the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells the disease is metastatic breast cancer not bone cancer the following stages are used for breast cancer this section describes the stages of breast cancer the breast cancer stage is based on the results of tests that are done on the tumor and lymph nodes removed during surgery and on other tests stage 0 carcinoma in situ there are 3 types of breast carcinoma in situ ductal carcinoma in situ dcis is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct the abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast in some cases dcis may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues at this time there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive lobular carcinoma in situ lcis is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lobules of the breast this condition seldom becomes invasive cancer information about lcis is not included in this summary paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the nipple only stage i in stage i cancer has formed stage i is divided into stages ia and ib in stage ia the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller cancer has not spread outside the breast in stage ib small clusters of breast cancer cells larger than 0 2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters are found in the lymph nodes and either no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller stage ii stage ii is divided into stages iia and iib in stage iia no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller cancer larger than 2 millimeters is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy or the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes in stage iib the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters small clusters of breast cancer cells larger than 0 2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters are found in the lymph nodes or larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the

cells are live and the size of the cells it also shows the shapes of the cells and whether there are tumor markers on the surface of the cells the cells are stained with a light sensitive dye placed in a fluid and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light the measurements are based on how the light sensitive dye reacts to the light bone scan a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells in the bone a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream the radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the body an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body sometimes a skeletal survey is done this is a procedure to x ray all of the bones in the body ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken

treatment are being tested in clinical trials radiosensitizers sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with penile cancer different types of treatments are available for patients with penile cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment four types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery is the most common treatment for all stages of penile cancer a doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations mohs microsurgery a procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers during the surgery the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen this type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove cancer on the skin it is also called mohs surgery laser surgery a surgical procedure that uses a laser beam a narrow beam of intense light as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor cryosurgery a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue this type of treatment is also called cryotherapy circumcision surgery to remove part or all of the foreskin of the penis wide local excision surgery to remove only the cancer and some normal tissue around it amputation of the penis surgery to remove part or all of the penis if part of the penis is removed it is a partial penectomy if all of the penis is removed it is a total penectomy lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly onto the skin topical chemotherapy or into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated topical chemotherapy may be used to treat stage 0 penile cancer see drugs approved for penile cancer for more information biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient s immune system to fight cancer substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost direct or restore the body s natural defenses against cancer this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy topical biologic therapy with imiquimod may be used to treat stage 0 penile cancer new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website radiosensitizers radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery the sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor it is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor a radioactive substance and or blue dye is injected near the tumor the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are not found it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes after the sentinel lymph node biopsy the surgeon removes the cancer patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options by stage

mutations in the best1 and prph2 genes cause vitelliform macular dystrophy best1 mutations are responsible for best disease and for some cases of the adult onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy changes in the prph2 gene can also cause the adult onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy however less than a quarter of all people with this form of the condition have mutations in the best1 or prph2 gene in most cases the cause of the adult onset form is unknown the best1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin this protein acts as a channel that controls the movement of charged chlorine atoms chloride ions into or out of cells in the retina mutations in the best1 gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride researchers have not determined how these malfunctioning channels are related to the buildup of lipofuscin in the macula and progressive vision loss the prph2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin 2 this protein is essential for the normal function of light sensing photoreceptor cells in the retina mutations in the prph2 gene cause vision loss by disrupting structures in these cells that contain light sensing pigments it is unclear why prph2 mutations affect only central vision in people with adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy,,,,Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy,,

key points there are different types of treatment for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer patients with lip and oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are expert in treating head and neck cancer two types of standard treatment are used surgery radiation therapy new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials chemotherapy hyperfractionated radiation therapy hyperthermia therapy patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment follow up tests may be needed there are different types of treatment for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer different types of treatment are available for patients with lip and oral cavity cancer some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment patients with lip and oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are expert in treating head and neck cancer treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer because the lips and oral cavity are important for breathing eating and talking patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment the medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals with special training in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer these include the following head and neck surgeon radiation oncologist dentist speech therapist dietitian psychologist rehabilitation specialist plastic surgeon two types of standard treatment are used surgery surgery removing the cancer in an operation is a common treatment for all stages of lip and oral cavity cancer surgery may include the following wide local excision removal of the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it if cancer has spread into bone surgery may include removal of the involved bone tissue neck dissection removal of lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck this is done when cancer may have spread from the lip and oral cavity plastic surgery an operation that restores or improves the appearance of parts of the body dental implants a skin graft or other plastic surgery may be needed to repair parts of the mouth throat or neck after removal of large tumors even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing there are two types of radiation therapy external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat lip and oral cavity cancer radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment it is also important for patients to have a dental exam before radiation therapy begins so that existing problems can be treated new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials this summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials it may not mention every new treatment being studied information about clinical trials is available from the nci website chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated hyperfractionated radiation therapy hyperfractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into small doses and the treatments are given more than once a day hyperthermia therapy hyperthermia therapy is a treatment in which body tissue is heated above normal temperature to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial for some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice clinical trials are part of the cancer research process clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment many of today s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials these have been retrieved from nci s listing of clinical trials follow up tests may be needed some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back these tests are sometimes called follow up tests or check ups treatment options by stage stage i lip and oral cavity cancer

how might madelung disease be treated to date the most effective treatment for madelung disease is surgery which may include surgical excision removal and or liposuction liposuction has gained popularity in more recent years since it results in minimal scarring it is also considered less invasive technically easier and better suited for people with a higher surgical or anaesthetic risk some researchers believe it is unnecessary to subject affected people to the risks of surgery because the condition is usually benign in their opinion surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities the limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal of lipomas the main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring however it offers the chance of more extensive debulking of affected areas reportedly it is rarely possible to remove the lipomas completely and they often recur after both of these procedures some researchers have reported modest success treating the condition with the medication salbutamol which increases the breakdown of fats abstaining from alcohol intake weight loss and correction of any associated metabolic endocrine abnormalities are also recommended,madelung disease,surgery,,Madelung disease,Surgery,

mutations in the rab23 or megf8 gene cause carpenter syndrome the rab23 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process called vesicle trafficking which moves proteins and other molecules within cells in sac like structures called vesicles the rab23 protein transports vesicles from the cell membrane to their proper location inside the cell vesicle trafficking is important for the transport of materials that are needed to trigger signaling during development for example the rab23 protein regulates a developmental pathway called the hedgehog signaling pathway that is critical in cell growth proliferation cell specialization and the normal shaping patterning of many parts of the body the megf8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear based on its structure the megf8 protein may be involved in cell processes such as sticking cells together cell adhesion and helping proteins interact with each other researchers also suspect that the megf8 protein plays a role in normal body patterning mutations in the rab23 or megf8 gene lead to the production of proteins with little or no function it is unclear how disruptions in protein function lead to the features of carpenter syndrome but it is likely that interference with normal body patterning plays a role for reasons that are unknown people with megf8 gene mutations are more likely to have dextrocardia and other organ positioning abnormalities and less severe craniosynostosis than individuals with rab23 gene mutations,"carpenter syndrome, dextrocardia",,,"Dextrocardia, Carpenter syndrome",,

a shortage of dopamine parkinson s disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired and or die normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine but when the neurons die or become impaired they produce less dopamine this shortage of dopamine causes the movement problems of people with parkinson s dopamine is a chemical messenger or neurotransmitter dopamine is responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and multiple brain regions the connection between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is critical to produce smooth purposeful movement loss of dopamine in this circuit results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement loss of norepinephrine people with parkinson s also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine norepinephrine which is closely related to dopamine is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system controls many automatic functions of the body such as heart rate and blood pressure the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the non movement features of parkinson s such as fatigue irregular blood pressure decreased gastric motility or movement of food through the digestive tract and postural hypotension postural hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a sitting or lying down position it may cause dizziness lightheadedness and in some cases loss of balance or fainting lewy bodies in brain cells many brain cells of people with parkinson s contain lewy bodies lewy bodies are unusual deposits or clumps of the brain protein alpha synuclein along with other proteins which are seen upon microscopic examination of the brain researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of parkinson s the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally or they may actually be helpful perhaps by keeping harmful proteins locked up so the cells can function genetic mutations although some cases of parkinson s appear to be hereditary and a few can be traced to specific genetic mutations most cases are sporadic sporadic means the disease occurs randomly and does not seem to run in families many researchers now believe that parkinson s disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinson s including mutations in the alpha synuclein gene they think that many more genes may be linked to the disorder studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinson s can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinson s environmental toxins although researchers increasingly recognize the importance of genetics in parkinson s disease most believe environmental exposures increase a person s risk of developing the disease even in inherited cases exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses there are a number of toxins that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans researchers are pursuing the question of whether pesticides and other environmental factors not yet identified also may cause parkinson s disease viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinson s mitochondria and free radicals research suggests that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinson s disease mitochondria are the energy producing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals free radicals are molecules that damage membranes proteins dna and other parts of the cell this damage is called oxidative stress changes to brain cells caused by oxidative stress including free radical damage to dna proteins and fats have been found in people with parkinson s clinical studies now underway test whether agents thought to improve energy metabolism and decrease oxidative stress slow the progression of parkinson s disease recent evidence suggests that mutations in genes linked to parkinsons disease result in mitochondrial dysfunction buildup of harmful proteins other research suggests that the cell s protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinson s causing proteins like alpha synuclein to build up to harmful levels and trigger premature cell death additional studies have found that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinson s may contribute to the death of nerve cells or neurons however the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown these studies also found that inflammation because of protein accumulation toxins or other factors may play a role in the disease however the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown researchers are exploring the possibility of vaccine development to decrease or prevent the accumulation of alpha synuclein while mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinson s disease scientists still do not know what causes cells that produce dopamine to die genes linked to parkinsons researchers have discovered several genes that are linked to parkinson s disease the first to be identified was alpha synuclein or snca studies have found that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinson s contain clumps of alpha synuclein protein this discovery revealed a possible link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease other genes linked to parkinson s include park2 park7 pink1 and lrrk2 park2 park7 and pink1 cause rare early onset forms of the disease mutations in the lrrk2 gene are common in specific populations including in people with parkinson s in north africa researchers are continuing to study the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinson s develops they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinson s but the nature of these links is not yet clear whole genome wide association studies or gwas of thousands of people with parkinson s disease are now underway to find gene variants that allow for an increased risk of developing parkinson s but are not necessarily causes of this disorder by themselves a recent international study found that two genes containing mutations known to cause rare hereditary forms of parkinsons disease are also associated with the more common sporadic form of the disease this finding came from a gwas which looked at dna samples of european people who had parkinsons disease and from those who did not have the disorder,"fatigue, fainting, stress",,,"Parkinson's Disease, Fatigue, Stress, Fainting",,

key points after penile cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for penile cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv after penile cancer has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein the gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri ultrasound exam a procedure in which high energy sound waves ultrasound are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes the echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram chest x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the chest an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body biopsy the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer the tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures sentinel lymph node biopsy the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery the sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor it is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor a radioactive substance and or blue dye is injected near the tumor the substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes the first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed a pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells if cancer cells are not found it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes lymph node dissection a procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes during surgery a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer this procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if penile cancer spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells the disease is metastatic penile cancer not lung cancer the following stages are used for penile cancer stage 0 carcinoma in situ in stage 0 abnormal cells or growths that look like warts are found on the surface of the skin of the penis these abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ stage i in stage i cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels the tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope stage ii in stage ii cancer has spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis also cancer has spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope or through connective tissue to erectile tissue spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection or beyond erectile tissue to the urethra stage iii stage iii is divided into stage iiia and stage iiib in stage iiia cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin cancer has also spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis also cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope or through connective tissue to erectile tissue spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection or beyond erectile tissue to the urethra in stage iiib cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin cancer has also spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis also cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope or through connective tissue to erectile tissue spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection or beyond erectile tissue to the urethra stage iv in stage iv cancer has spread to tissues near the penis such as the prostate and may have spread to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis or to one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis or cancer has spread

mutations in the gnptab gene cause mucolipidosis iii alpha beta this gene provides instructions for making a part subunit of an enzyme called glcnac 1 phosphotransferase this enzyme helps prepare certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells glcnac 1 phosphotransferase is involved in the process of attaching a molecule called mannose 6 phosphate m6p to specific digestive enzymes just as luggage is tagged at the airport to direct it to the correct destination enzymes are often tagged after they are made so they get to where they are needed in the cell m6p acts as a tag that indicates a digestive enzyme should be transported to the lysosome mutations in the gnptab gene that cause mucolipidosis iii alpha beta result in reduced activity of glcnac 1 phosphotransferase these mutations disrupt the tagging of digestive enzymes with m6p which prevents many enzymes from reaching the lysosomes digestive enzymes that do not receive the m6p tag end up outside the cell where they have increased activity the shortage of digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate there conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes including mucolipidosis iii alpha beta are called lysosomal storage disorders the signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis iii alpha beta are most likely due to the shortage of digestive enzymes inside lysosomes and the effects these enzymes have outside the cell mutations in the gnptab gene can also cause a similar but more severe disorder called mucolipidosis ii alpha beta these mutations completely eliminate the function of glcnac 1 phosphotransferase mucolipidosis iii alpha beta and mucolipidosis ii alpha beta represent two ends of a spectrum of disease severity,,,,Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta,,

treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the disease and whether complications are present in the early stages of cirrhosis the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications as cirrhosis progresses a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications treatment may include the following avoiding alcohol and illegal substances people with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances as both will cause more liver damage preventing problems with medications people with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications over the counter medications or vitamins people with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications such as herbs cirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood when this slowdown occurs medications act longer than expected and build up in the body some medications and vitamins may also affect liver function viral hepatitis vaccination and screening all people with cirrhosis should consider vaccination against hepatitis a and b an infection with one of these hepatitis viruses can cause cirrhosis to get worse vaccination can easily prevent both infections people with cirrhosis should also get a screening blood test for hepatitis c treating causes of cirrhosis health care providers can treat some causes of cirrhosis for example by prescribing antiviral medications for hepatitis b and c in some instances these medications cure the viral infection health care providers treat autoimmune hepatitis with corticosteroids and other medications that suppress the immune system health care providers can treat hemochromatosis and wilson diseaseinherited forms of liver disease caused by the buildup of iron or copper in the liverif detected early health care providers usually treat liver diseases due to blockage or loss of bile ducts with ursodiol actigall urso ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver which are toxic and build up in the liver when the bile ducts are blocked treating symptoms and complications of cirrhosis itching and abdominal pain a health care provider may give medications to treat various symptoms of cirrhosis such as itching and abdominal pain portal hypertension a health care provider may prescribe a beta blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension beta blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload varices beta blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy this procedure involves using an endoscopea small flexible tube with a lightto look for varices the health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center people who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes edema and ascites health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites a health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis a health care provider may prescribe bacteria fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection he or she may prescribe oral antibiotics however severe infection with ascites requires intravenous iv antibiotics hepatic encephalopathy a health care provider treats hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum a health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled hepatorenal syndrome some people with cirrhosis who develop hepatorenal syndrome must undergo regular dialysis treatment which filters wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys people may also need medications to improve blood flow through the kidneys osteoporosis a health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density gallstones and bile duct stones a health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones he or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which uses balloons and basketlike devices to retrieve the bile duct stones liver cancer a health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early

mutations in the arhgap31 dll4 dock6 eogt notch1 or rbpj gene can cause adams oliver syndrome because some affected individuals do not have mutations in one of these genes it is likely that other genes that have not been identified are also involved in this condition each of the known genes plays an important role during embryonic development and changes in any one of them can impair this tightly controlled process leading to the signs and symptoms of adams oliver syndrome the proteins produced from the arhgap31 and dock6 genes are both involved in the regulation of proteins called gtpases which transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development the arhgap31 and dock6 proteins appear to be especially important for gtpase regulation during development of the limbs skull and heart gtpases are often called molecular switches because they can be turned on and off the dock6 protein turns them on and the arhgap31 protein turns them off mutations in the dock6 gene lead to production of an abnormally short dock6 protein that is likely unable to turn on gtpases which reduces their activity mutations in the arhgap31 gene also decrease gtpase activity by leading to production of an abnormally active arhgap31 protein which turns off gtpases when it normally would not this decline in gtpase activity leads to the skin problems bone malformations and other features characteristic of adams oliver syndrome the proteins produced from the notch1 dll4 and rbpj genes are part of a signaling pathway known as the notch pathway notch signaling controls how certain types of cells develop in the growing embryo including those that form the bones heart muscles nerves and blood vessels the notch1 and dll4 proteins fit together like a lock and its key to stimulate one part of the notch pathway which is important for development of blood vessels the notch1 and dll4 gene mutations involved in adams oliver syndrome likely impair notch1 signaling which may underlie blood vessel and heart abnormalities in some people with adams oliver syndrome researchers suspect that the other features of the condition may be due to abnormal blood vessel development before birth signaling through notch1 and other notch proteins stimulates the rbp j protein produced from the rbpj gene to attach bind to specific regions of dna and control the activity of genes that play a role in cellular development in multiple tissues throughout the body the rbpj gene mutations involved in adams oliver syndrome alter the region of the rbp j protein that normally binds dna the altered protein is unable to bind to dna preventing it from turning on particular genes these changes in gene activity impair the proper development of the skin bones and other tissues leading to the features of adams oliver syndrome little is known about how mutations in the eogt gene cause adams oliver syndrome the protein produced from this gene modifies certain proteins by transferring a molecule called n acetylglucosamine to them it is thought that the eogt protein modifies notch proteins which stimulate the notch signaling pathway however the impact of the modification on notch signaling is unclear at least three mutations in the eogt gene have been identified in people with adams oliver syndrome but how the genetic changes contribute to the signs and symptoms of this disorder is still unknown,,,,,,

key points after adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body the following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma stage i stage ii stage iii stage iv after adult soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body the process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging staging of soft tissue sarcoma is also based on the grade and size of the tumor whether it is superficial close to the skin s surface or deep and whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body the information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease it is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment the following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process physical exam and history an exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual a history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken chest x ray an x ray of the organs and bones inside the chest an x ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body blood chemistry studies a procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body an unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease complete blood count cbc a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets the amount of hemoglobin the protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells the portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells ct scan cat scan a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside of the body such as the lung and abdomen taken from different angles the pictures are made by a computer linked to an x ray machine a dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly this procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography mri magnetic resonance imaging a procedure that uses a magnet radio waves and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body this procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri pet scan positron emission tomography scan a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body a small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein the pet scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do the results of these tests are viewed together with the results of the tumor biopsy to find out the stage of the soft tissue sarcoma before treatment is given sometimes chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given as the initial treatment and afterwards the soft tissue sarcoma is staged again there are three ways that cancer spreads in the body cancer can spread through tissue the lymph system and the blood tissue the cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas lymph system the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system the cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body blood the cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood the cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body when cancer spreads to another part of the body it is called metastasis cancer cells break away from where they began the primary tumor and travel through the lymph system or blood lymph system the cancer gets into the lymph system travels through the lymph vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body blood the cancer gets into the blood travels through the blood vessels and forms a tumor metastatic tumor in another part of the body the metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung the cancer cells in the lung are actually soft tissue sarcoma cells the disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma not lung cancer the following stages are used for adult soft tissue sarcoma stage i stage i is divided into stages ia and ib in stage ia the tumor is low grade likely to grow and spread slowly and 5 centimeters or smaller it may be either superficial in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below or deep in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue in stage ib the tumor is low grade likely to grow and spread slowly and larger than 5 centimeters it may be either superficial in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below or deep in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue stage ii stage ii is divided into stages iia and iib in stage iia the tumor is mid grade somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly or high grade likely to grow and spread quickly and 5 centimeters or smaller it may be either superficial in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below or deep in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue in stage iib the tumor is mid grade somewhat likely to grow and spread quickly and larger than 5 centimeters it may be either superficial in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below or deep in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue stage iii in stage iii the tumor is either high grade likely to grow and spread quickly larger than 5 centimeters and either superficial in subcutaneous tissue with no spread into connective tissue or muscle below or deep in the muscle and may be in connective or subcutaneous tissue or any grade any size and has spread to nearby lymph nodes stage iii cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes is advanced stage iii stage iv in stage iv the tumor is any grade any size and may have spread to nearby

until recently an accurate protein measurement required a 24 hour urine collection in a 24 hour collection the patient urinates into a container which is kept refrigerated between trips to the bathroom the patient is instructed to begin collecting urine after the first trip to the bathroom in the morning every drop of urine for the rest of the day is to be collected in the container the next morning the patient adds the first urination after waking and the collection is complete in recent years researchers have found that a single urine sample can provide the needed information in the newer technique the amount of albumin in the urine sample is compared with the amount of creatinine a waste product of normal muscle breakdown the measurement is called a urine albumin to creatinine ratio uacr a urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine 30 mg g is a warning that there may be a problem if the laboratory test exceeds 30 mg g another uacr test should be done 1 to 2 weeks later if the second test also shows high levels of protein the person has persistent proteinuria a sign of declining kidney function and should have additional tests to evaluate kidney function,,creatinine,,,Creatinine,

carotid artery disease is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the carotid arteries you have two common carotid arteries one on each side of your neck they each divide into internal and external carotid arteries the internal carotid arteries supply oxygen rich blood to your brain the external carotid arteries supply oxygen rich blood to your face scalp and neck carotid arteries carotid artery disease is serious because it can cause a stroke also called a brain attack a stroke occurs if blood flow to your brain is cut off if blood flow is cut off for more than a few minutes the cells in your brain start to die this impairs the parts of the body that the brain cells control a stroke can cause lasting brain damage long term disability such as vision or speech problems or paralysis an inability to move or death overview carotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the united states over time plaque hardens and narrows the arteries this may limit the flow of oxygen rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body for example if plaque builds up in the coronary heart arteries a heart attack can occur if plaque builds up in the carotid arteries a stroke can occur a stroke also can occur if blood clots form in the carotid arteries this can happen if the plaque in an artery cracks or ruptures blood cell fragments called platelets plate lets stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots blood clots can partly or fully block a carotid artery a piece of plaque or a blood clot also can break away from the wall of the carotid artery the plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brain s smaller arteries this can block blood flow in the artery and cause a stroke carotid artery disease may not cause signs or symptoms until the carotid arteries are severely narrowed or blocked for some people a stroke is the first sign of the disease outlook carotid artery disease is a major cause of stroke in the united states other conditions such as certain heart problems and bleeding in the brain also can cause strokes lifestyle changes medicines and medical procedures can help prevent or treat carotid artery disease and may reduce the risk of stroke if you think you re having a stroke you need urgent treatment call 911 right away if you have symptoms of a stroke do not drive yourself to the hospital you have the best chance for full recovery if treatment to open a blocked artery is given within 4 hours of symptom onset the sooner treatment occurs the better your chances of recovery,"carotid artery disease, stroke, paralysis, atherosclerosis, heart attack, blood clots, bleeding",,,"Stroke, Heart Attack, Paralysis, Blood Clots, Bleeding, Carotid Artery Disease, Atherosclerosis",,

mutations in the c19orf12 gene cause mpan the protein produced from this gene is found in the membrane of cellular structures called mitochondria which are the energy producing centers of the cell although its function is unknown researchers suggest that the c19orf12 protein plays a role in the maintenance of fat lipid molecules a process known as lipid homeostasis the gene mutations that cause this condition lead to an altered c19orf12 protein that likely has little or no function it is unclear how these genetic changes lead to the neurological problems associated with mpan researchers are working to determine whether there is a link between problems with lipid homeostasis and brain iron accumulation and how these abnormalities might contribute to the features of this disorder,,,,,,
the kidneys are two bean shaped organs each about the size of a fist they are located just below the rib cage one on each side of the spine every day the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine composed of wastes and extra fluid the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters the bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination,,,,,,
